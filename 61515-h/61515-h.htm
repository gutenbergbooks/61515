<br />Carl H. Chapman</span></h2>
<p>The events leading to the publication of the following report by John H.
Moselage has been one of the highlights of many years of work with amateur
archaeologists. At first meeting it seemed that he protested too much that he
wanted to do &ldquo;real archaeology,&rdquo; but this desire turned out to be quite genuine.
He really wanted help. He wanted to do the job right at any cost.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm and determination clothed the man almost completely. Working
with him was a challenge. During the few days of vacation he could spend
with regular crews of professional archaeologists his quest for knowledge, techniques,
methods and the proper tools was almost insatiable. Then followed long
letters containing notes, profiles, photographs and maps, to be criticized, and
with each new step the request for assurance of proper techniques and accepted
methods before moving ahead. Months stretched into years; bundles of detailed
notes, long letters of explanation, copies of hour by hour, day by day descriptions
of work and progress were frequently interspersed by long distance calls
to solve the problems in the field as they arose. His telephone greeting was
&ldquo;Mr. Chapman, I&rsquo;ve got a problem!&rdquo; It was usually thirty minutes to an hour
later before a long distance operator could once again clear the line between
Missouri and Tennessee or Missouri and Arkansas.</p>
<p>All his spare time, all the influence he could exert to get his friends to join
him, were used to progress the work. His determination carried him through
rain, mud, flood, and cold, in order to complete the job. His enthusiasm and
drive carried many others along with him to the conclusion of the Lawhorn Site
investigation.</p>
<p>Study of pottery types and projectile points became his steady reading diet.
Long hours were spent in washing, numbering and cataloging the specimens
from the digs. Analysis of the material through compilation of ground plans of
the excavation, of house structures, and of vertical profiles was a tedious process
necessitating the aid of many people. The most generous of these in giving time,
advise, and use of facilities was Mr. Charles H. Nash.</p>
<p>The resulting report on the Lawhorn Site which follows is testimony to
the unstinting efforts that John Moselage has made. It is an outstanding example
of what can be done by a true amateur archaeologist and is a worthy goal
for other dedicated amateur archaeologists. The search for knowledge has always
led man to his greatest achievements. Research is never-ending as knowledge
in any area of endeavor is never complete. The achievement in this instance
is a solid contribution to the archaeology of the Eastern United States.</p>

<p>The success of the Lawhorn endeavors is due to the encouragement and efforts
of many people. However, without the guidance of Carl H. Chapman, this
venture could not have been undertaken. From its beginning, he always found
time in his busy schedule to help me with the many problems which arose during
the course of the excavation and narration of the site.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Nash, Tennessee State Parks Archaeologist, aided in preliminary
analysis of the material remains, analyzed the burial complex and prepared that
section for this report. Mr. Nash also edited the first draft of the report and prepared
the first typescript. The time and effort expended by Mr. Nash is sincerely
appreciated.</p>
<p>Prior to the final draft and editing, a conference was held at the University
of Missouri for an analysis and interpretation of the site material. Those participating
in the conference were Carl H. Chapman, Robert T. Bray, Richard A.
Marshall, Edwin Sudderth, Richard Bradham, and the writer. Editing of the second
and final draft was by Robert T. Bray and Carl H. Chapman. The job is one
which too often goes without recognition of the many long hours which are
necessary in producing the finished report. Especial thanks are due the property
owners, Mr. W. O. Lawhorn, whose cooperation made this investigation possible.
It is with deep and sincere appreciation that I recognize the aid and assistance
given me by my family&mdash;my daughters, my son, and my wife, and any
success is shared equally with them.</p>
<p>Though the day-by-day crew seldom exceeded four in number, many gave
unselfishly of their time making possible the successful completion of the field
work. The following is a list of those most helpful:</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION</span></h2>
<p>The Lawhorn site is located on the Leachville-Arkansas-Missouri Quadrangle
of the U.S. Army Engineer Map in the NW SW Sec. 5, T15N, R7E. This lies
along the watercourse of the St. Francis River, in Craighead County four miles
north of Monette, Arkansas. In all probability, at the time the site was occupied,
the main river channel was not far away.</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows the general location of the site in northeast Arkansas just
below the boot-heel of Missouri. The larger and better known sites shown on
this map indicate the extent of the Mississippian groups in this region. The site
is close to one just north and one or two south which seem to be almost identical
judging by surface finds and tests. The Lawhorn material is mostly Mississippian
or has a Mississippian component that predominates in the materials
found. An early component is Woodland or Baytown but it is not well represented
on the site.</p>

<p>Early St. Francis River meanders flowed eastward along the southern end
of the site, and in doing so washed away, then redeposited new silt over that section.
This showed quite clearly in the R22 profile drawings. Other than this, in
discussing the general nature of the site, it must be recognized that the New
Madrid earthquake of 1812 changed the contours and drainage of this area to a
great extent. It is to be noted that the Lawhorn site lies on a natural levee or
ridge; that is, a ridge in the terms of the people who live in this flat country. It
is some three to five feet higher than the surrounding land. This rise is adequate
to keep the site dry and well drained through periods of high water and floods
except during abnormal years. An Army Engineer aerial photograph of the area
(<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) shows the general topographic relationships. The old meander of the
St. Francis River, where it cut through the southern end of the site, can still be
made out. The most recent of the old channels of the St. Francis are quite apparent
in the densely overgrown jungle-like terrain. This is the area known as
the Sunken Lands.</p>
<p>The higher elevations on either side are protected by levees and by drainage
ditches to carry off the immediate drainage water to a point where it can be
siphoned back into the St. Francis. It is this drainage ditch which was cut recently
through the Lawhorn site and which can be seen very clearly as it parallels
the new levee. The site itself is in the left central part of the figure as
marked by the delineating outline (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The black spots showing in the aerial
photo are areas of higher moisture content due to irregular drying and perhaps
have more to do with the New Madrid earthquake disturbances than with
archaeological phenomena.</p>
<p><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> indicates the extent of the excavations and the method of horizontal
control through a grid system. Base lines were established on the south
and west sides of the site so that all squares carry an E (east) distance number
combined with an N (north) distance number. Ten foot intervals or squares
were used so that square 17R30, for example, would be marked by the southwest
corner stake of a square 170 feet north and 300 feet west of datum. Datum
control point was marked by an iron rod firmly set in the ground.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">GEOLOGICAL SETTING</span></h2>
<p>The geology of the Monette area along the St. Francis River is that of a
complex river valley. It is further complicated by the New Madrid earthquake of
1812 and perhaps some earlier disturbances of the same nature.</p>
<p>On a substratum of undifferentiated plio-miocene deposits, the cross-sectional
profile of the valley (Fisk 1944, Plate 15, Sheet 1) shows an elevation of
100 to 125 feet above the present mean sea level as the base of the alluvial deposit.
The top of this extensive graveliferous alluvium, 225 feet above sea level,
was laid down by the Ohio River as its channel pattern changed through the
centuries, burying older channels under later ones as the ocean levels rose and
the ice age melted out of existence, thus forming the area known as the Malden
Plain. The present surface contour at the town of Monette is 235 feet. At the
site under study the elevation readings are from 237 to 240 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>This valley story is duplicated west of the area known locally as Crowley&rsquo;s
Ridge where the Mississippi River flowed during the waning of the ice age.
Crowley&rsquo;s Ridge, it should be noted here, is an old land surface that was not
eroded by the late glacial run-off waters. It is this relatively unaltered ridge of
land that originally separated the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers during the formative
age of the present alluvial valley. This ridge, only a few miles west of Monette,
Arkansas, offered a totally different environment and was, presumably,
one which the Lawhorn people made, at least, seasonal use of. The St. Francis
River channel, lying close to the eastern edge of Crowley&rsquo;s Ridge is the end result
of these early braided Ohio River channels while today the Black River has
replaced the Mississippi in the western valley.</p>
<p>By 2000 B.C. the Mississippi River had moved to the east side of Crowley&rsquo;s
Ridge and well east of the Monette area. The Ohio River was then in the vicinity
of the present Mississippi River. During the next 1000 years the Mississippi
channel moved gradually eastward until it was flowing close to the Ohio
River and roughly parallel to it, merging in the vicinity of Helena, Arkansas. By
the beginning of the Christian era, the two rivers had joined near Cairo, Illinois
and so began the modern alluvial valley pattern (Fisk, 1944).</p>
<p>If the interpretation of the time of geological developments is correct the
story of mankind in this region would be limited to something less than 6000
years. Early Man may have wandered the shoreline of the ancient river channels,
but if he did there is very little likelihood that any of his remains would be
found today in this valley area since they would have been washed away or covered
with the refilling of the valley.</p>
<p>Further complicating the picture there has been a tremendous amount of
recent geological disturbance in this area due to the New Madrid earthquake and
possibly others of earlier date. These geological developments set part of the environmental
state for the users of the Lawhorn site. Later developments contrived
to destroy much of the evidence left by man as a series of earthquakes
changed the face of the land (Humphries, 1960, p. 32).</p>
<p>Another factor that must be taken into account is the recent work of the
United States Army Engineers in protecting the higher lands from the floods of
the St. Francis River Sunken Lands and in draining this entire region. Within
the last five years a new ditch has been dug parallel to a new levee on the east
side so that it cut through a section of the Lawhorn archaeological deposit. This
work laid bare many skeletons and considerable occupational debris. Harmful as
this activity is to archaeological sites it was nevertheless an important factor in
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
bringing this site to the attention of the writer. It is unfortunate that most sites
thus destroyed, in whole or in part, by drainage and levee building excavations
cannot be similarly salvaged. Governmental machinery is available for this work
but unfortunately there has been no institutional agency ready, willing and able
to accept the burden in this area.</p>
<p>The first evidences of man at the Lawhorn site are sand tempered pottery
and associated dart points. These show that this site was occupied by man long
enough to produce an archaeological deposit judged to be Woodland or Baytown.
The deposit is thin and gives little evidence of ever having been much
deeper. Above this thin evidence were shell tempered pottery and related stone,
bone and shell artifacts that indicated a more intensive use of the site at a later
time by Mississippian people.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">METHODOLOGY</span></h2>
<p>The archaeological methods used were standard handtool methods. The following
excerpts from day to day field notes will give a fair idea of how these
were applied. These appear in essentially unedited form.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Sunday, October 21, 1956</h3>
<p>We began the little project with the first crew, Mr. Irby Long, surveyor;
C. B. and R. E. Gaylon; J. R. Marret of Caldwell, Missouri; Josephine, Carolyn,
J. H., Jr., and myself (John Moselage).</p>
<p>The work consisted of determining the extent of the site, putting up the
map table, and staking out the boundaries of the site and recording them on the
map.</p>
<p>We had expected to have started the contour lines on the map but determining
the boundaries of the site required most of the day.</p>
<p>The above mentioned boundaries were permanent markers, being long pieces
of steel pipe. The steel markers were put in at the NW corner, and the SW
corner; wooden stakes were used in the NE corner and SE corner, these were of
wood due to that part of the site being in cultivation, however, all of our measurements
used in regard to locating the squares are based on the measurements
of the SW steel stake as it is the R 8 line although it is the SW corner of the site.
The reason it is the R 8 line is due to the levee running in a NW direction and
at the NW corner the site is 80 ft. in a westerly direction. All squares are to
the right as the starting point is at the levee.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Saturday October 27, 1956</h3>
<p>On the site early this A.M. were Mr. Long our surveyor, the Gaylons, John
Jr., J. T. King, E. R. Deen, and myself. We all worked hard this day. We divided
up into smaller crews and mapped in the contour lines, while the others staked
out the R 8 line. This line, as before mentioned, began on the southwest
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
corner of the site. The 32 line appeared to be about the center of the site due to
the angles of the site. It was the likely point to begin the test trench, as we
thought, and we began at the levee working in the direction of east on the south
side of the 32 line. The soil was exceedingly hard and we had to work with
small picks (Army surplus). During late evening I had the wall scraped down
and drew the first profile.</p>
<p>Mr. King&rsquo;s part of the trench did not work as easily as the part I had undertaken,
and because the trench was irregular in depth, and the hour so late,
we decided to resume work after there had been a good rain, in hopes that the
ground would be in better condition to work, as the ground was like concrete.
Though the soil was so hard, the profile was good.</p>
<p>There was distinct separation in soil colors and they changed in other parts
of the trench. On the top was a brown color and at the bottom was brown with
a band of what appeared to be ashes through most of the center.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we all felt proud of the map, and having actually
started digging.</p>
<p>On the section line, or corner of the section, (NW corner) is a brass marker
with elevation stamped on it, this was used to get the elevation of the highest
point on the site.</p>
<p>This same elevation was transferred to a stake by a large gum tree. This
stake is of walnut. The elevation was also transferred to a stake in the levee
near the 32 line.</p>
<h3 id="c9">November 25, 1956</h3>
<p>In company of J. L. Henson, we staked out square 38R9 of which over half
was in the seep ditch. With such a small crew we decided on that small part of
a square to excavate.</p>
<p>We recorded the datum depths on the NW and SW corners&mdash;the others
being in the ditch&mdash;and removed the plow zone. At the bottom of the plow
zone there were strips that measured approximately two inches, running in a
straight line. With lots of concern we finally figured that it was where the bottom
of the plow had sloped off toward the ditch, and we wanted to level the
next surface, so the established depth of the plow zone for this square was set
at DD 6.5 though at one edge it was not that deep. There was not anything
that we could report for that level, and we went six inches lower to DD (Datum
Depth) 7.0. In this area a pit showed up for when we scraped off the level at
DD 7.0 we had the outline of a pit.</p>
<p>We cross sectioned the pit to obtain a profile, and it extended six inches below
the top of the subsoil. The profile drawn shows the pit starting at DD 7.0
which is where we first discovered it. Subsoil was on an average of DD 7.6.</p>
<p>The outline of the pit was not as distinct as shown on the Feature form but
that is closest lines that we could obtain of it. I packaged the pit material and
classed it as belonging to the level from DD 6.5 to 7.0. See feature form 2 for
details.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c10">38R5, Sunday, April 28, 1957</h3>
<p>Accompanied by J. L. Henson, Chas. Scheel and John Jr., we began work
on the site. For the last few weeks we have removed our stakes after each day&rsquo;s
work because of the farming expected on the site. This causes an extra amount
of work each trip that could have been used so badly in the excavation.</p>
<p>After removing the plowzone, the square was scraped off, and there was no
pattern or postmold to be seen. We removed all potsherds, bone, and stone F. S.
(Field Specimen) 83 DD 6.5 to 7.0, and again scraped off the soil, and again
there was no pattern. We also found a projectile point in the above mentioned
level F. S. 84. We removed the next 6 in. of the square collecting potsherds, etc.,
F. S. 85. Also in this level the soil changed from the strong midden rich brown
in color to that color of the subsoil, which is of a light sandy brown to yellow.
This soil presented a problem, it was of a mottled color, the same as found
through the subsoil. There is so little difference between this soil and the absolute
sterile soil. This soil has been checked the entire length of the site in the
new seep ditch, which is over 6 ft. deep and there is no doubt of its being sterile.
This situation is of great concern because of the burials that have been found in
what appears to be the subsoil. There is positively no connection between this
burial and the dark brown midden in the soil above. There is no sign of a pit
leading to the burial, but there is a difference in pottery styles, texture, even the
feel of the material found in what appears to be the subsoil, and in that found
in association with the dark brown midden.</p>
<p>Mr. Scheel, working in the square with me, commented on the change of
color, and I asked him what he would think if I told him there was a burial below
where he was working. He asked me how I knew, and I told him of the legs
being in the last square we worked, and he said it would be Woodland, as there
was no connection with the Mississippi midden above the soil we were then
working in. We were being pressed for time at this part of the square so we
narrowed the square to 5 &times; 10 ft. and when we reached the burial, we also reached
water. The river at this time was over the banks and seemed to boil up in the
square; this presented a real problem. We debated as to whether we should quit
the square and fill it up or do the best we could. We thought of filling in the
10&prime; &times; 10&prime; square and reopening it a year later but decided that we would finish
since we had lots of decisive facts and we needed the rest to complete forms. We
gathered up boards to stand on to keep from sinking in the sand, and the condition
of the bone was so poor, being wet, it was just impossible for us to remove
it. Though I did get the skull taped up before trying to remove it, the other
bones were so soft they crumbled when handled, so the skull was all the bone
that I could remove in one piece. There were three pottery vessels with this
burial, a bottle, which was upside down, a bowl beside the head (it too was upside
down) and a jar by the right arm which was right side up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>While working in square 37R5 this burial was partly in it (37R5) and there
weren&rsquo;t feet present (see photo 34). The absence of feet has occurred before and
it is a trait that may be distinctive.</p>
<p>While removing the skull of this burial, which was on the line (R6), the
arm of another burial, in square 38R6, was found. It was not removed, but was left
for future investigation since the conditions are the same as the above mentioned
burial. The soil color in the levels below the midden is of great concern
in this area; there seems to be a discoloration in what appears to be the top part
of the subsoil. There will be a thorough check made of the soil.</p>
<h3 id="c11">15R8, June 21, 1957</h3>
<p>Accompanied by J. L. Henson and son, Charles, James Vorus, and John, Jr.,
we moved to the part of the site that I rented for the summer, and decided on a
square on the highest part on this end of the site. We established the square
15R8 and put up the shelter over the square to protect us from the sun. We removed
all potsherds from the plow zone to DD 4.7, at DD 4.7. There appeared
a black area in the NW &frac14; of the square. The NE &frac14; had indications of burned
clay. The black area suggested a pit but there was no outline of one. At DD 5.0
the black area was still there and contained above the normal amount of charcoal
but still no define outline of a pit. At DD 5.5 we outlined the black area
and sketched in the square form. At DD 6.0 the area did not exist. The only
difference in this area and the rest of the square was the dark color; the contents
or number of potsherds, and other evidences appeared to be the same as
the rest of the square. I could not positively say that this area was a pit.</p>
<p>At DD 5.5 the soil changed to a lighter brown. There were tree root impressions
visible that were not visible in the above level. This suggested another
natural level. Also, there was little material to be found. The few sherds
were not in a midden. There was little other sign of an occupation in this soil
(the lighter brown soil).</p>
<p>This lighter brown soil was mottled in color, having light sandy streaks
and circles and at DD 7.2 there was yellow sand. In this mottled sandy soil was
a burial (25) under the R9 line and less than one foot north of the 15 line, and
there was no sign of the midden with this burial, though there was a little darker
appearance of the mottled soil. The members of the party and all kept up
with activities throughout the whole square and it was plain to all that there
seemed to be no connection between this burial and the midden above. There
was a separation at the knees. Also, there appeared a sunken place in the pelvic
region which was reflected in the midden above. It would also account for the
separation between the bones at the knees. There was a deformity of the right
femur which should be explained at a later time after examination by proper persons.</p>
<p>A different method of taking the soil profile was followed. This time I used
the transit at each running foot of the east wall to record the lines inscribed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the wall.</p>
<p>According to the profiles of the four walls, they were nearly uniform in
depth, that is, no marked difference was present to warrant drawing all four. The
east wall was used because of the sunken area, on the R9 line. During the afternoon
we had a shower of rain though we worked on through it.</p>
<p>We finished work at nightfall and then filled the square. It was nearly 9:00
P.M. when we finished. We arrived home after 11:00 P.M.</p>
<p>Highlights of the trip were when we found the burial which was quite a
bit of excitement for James Vorus; the boat ride to the car in the darkness; and
when we all got to the nearest store we each had three king size cold drinks.</p>
<p>In regard to the sunken area in the square which has shown up in the midden
and in the burial in the subsoil, perhaps (this) has some connection with
the New Madrid earthquake. This site is in the Sunken Lands. There was also
the absence of the two strata profile in the midden. Perhaps future work will reveal
the reason for the change.</p>
<h3 id="c12">7R13, July 14, 1957</h3>
<p>James Vorus, Mr. F. N. Davis, John, Jr., and myself arrived at the site early
this A.M. We had discussed moving to the edge of the site on the south end,
which we did. We established square 7R13 and set up for work. The plowzone
produced little material. The potsherds were scarce at the bottom of the plowzone.
There was no pattern of pits, or other features to be found.</p>
<p>The next level, DD 6.2 to DD 6.5 produced several possible postmolds,
but when cross-sectioned, they were either tree roots or just shallow black areas&mdash;not
postmolds.</p>
<p>This level produced little material, only a few potsherds and debris. From
Datum depth 6.5 to 7.0 there was just a handful of potsherds. This is a marked
difference over the rest of the site that had been excavated to date. As a rule, the
sherds are plentiful. At DD 7.0 when the surface was scraped off, the outline
of a fireplace appeared and in the fireplace was a small flat stone, under which
was a considerable amount of charred root. Readily identifiable were nut shells
and hulls.</p>
<p>At DD 7.5 there was the outline of two pits in the subsoil (subsoil first
showed at DD 7.2), one small pit, the other three feet in diameter. The pits
were cross-sectioned with a two-foot trench. The two pits were then photographed.
The north wall was then scraped and marked with lines at each running
foot, the profile sketched in the wall, then photographed, and drawn on the
graph paper, using datum depths at each line on each running foot of the profile.
The square was filled shortly before dark.</p>
<h3 id="c13">31R17, March 15, 1958</h3>
<p>The crew on the site early this A.M., and we decided to work on the east
side of the ditch and in the vicinity of the burials that had been found previously.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
We staked out square 31R17, and began work; we removed the plow zone.
We scraped off the new surface in search of any possible pattern of pit outline,
or postmold, and there was none to be found. Potsherds, and other items, were
collected for that level F. S. 185 which was the plow zone.</p>
<p>With no visible pattern in the horizontal profile at DD 5.0 we began the
next level collecting potsherds, which were designated F. S. 187. At DD 5.0 to
DD 5.5, and at two-tenths of a foot in the level there appeared the top of a
skull (See burial form 34). Burial 34 had a skull at its feet, possibly a trophy
skull, and was a positive association with burial 34. At the completion of the
square, the following information was recorded:</p>
<p>There were four burials directly beneath Burial 34, and in a very compact
arrangement; two of the burials were adults, and two of them infants. They
were in a very disturbed condition, at the time they were discovered. The problem
arose as to what took place. They were in an east-west direction, and in
very compact arrangement. It seems as though each burial was disturbed when
each succeeding burial was placed in the pit. The question arose, due to the
placement of one atop each other in such an exact arrangement, could there have
been some sort of mark to denote the location (That is, if each one had a time
space between them.) But the search produced nothing to indicate such a marker;
no postmolds could be found.</p>
<p>These burials began atop the subsoil, and continued upward to datum depth
5.2. If there was a pit outline in the square it was not visible to us, and that is
one of the items we are so careful about. In spite of the fact that the burials
were disturbed and in a very poor state of preservation, one assuring condition
was the position of the remaining vertebrae which indicated the four burials
were under burial 34. There was a broken bottle associated with these burials,
and in all probability belonged to burial 34 F. S. 191; DD 5.7 to the bottom of
the vessel.</p>
<p>The soil changed to a lighter brown at DD 5.5 and continued about the
same to subsoil which was listed as DD 6.0. The DD was based on the average
depth of subsoil.</p>
<p>About two inches south of the 32 line, there appeared another burial, which
was almost entirely in the square to the north, square 32R17. The south half of
square 32R17 was also opened in order to record this burial. In doing so, the
top of a bottle appeared, about two feet north of Burial 32, and nearby were the
fragments of an infant burial and there were no artifacts associated with it. The
burial was partly in the plow zone, and was almost completely destroyed. The
bone was in poor condition and crumbled in removal.</p>
<p>The bottle was associated with a burial. The burial was on top of the subsoil
and consisted of part of one arm, the radius, ulna, and hand&mdash;nothing else.
There was no indication of disturbance, and no missing bones were found in the
midden. Less than two feet north of burial 34 was another burial, the feet extending
into parts of squares 31R16 and 32R16. The burial was in a shallow pit
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
in the subsoil, and had one association with it, a bowl F. S. 190. The vessel had
little nodes on four sides near the top, four nodes to each side except one side
which had three nodes. This burial was .4 ft. below the average datum depth of
the subsoil of this square. There was no disturbance to burial 32 and burial 33
was partly under burial 32. Burial 33 was in a lighter brown soil than that above
datum depth 5.5.</p>
<p>There have been many burials in somewhat similar condition in regard to
the missing bones, both disturbed and undisturbed, throughout the whole site
in which burials were found. The skeletons were removed to the best of our
ability, one of the burials in its entirety.</p>
<p>We filled the square and returned home.</p>
<h3 id="c14">27R32, January 25, 1959</h3>
<p>J. T. King, Dan Printup, and myself returned to the site. Continuation was
in square 27R32 beginning at DD 5.5. There had been some disturbance to the
square since we were there last. A large potsherd had been removed from the
ground plan DD 5.5, and a portion of the skull that was showing in the east
wall of the square had been dug out. Most of the skull remained. Otherwise
things were just as we had left it.</p>
<p>We began removing the level DD 5.5-6.0. The soil was in the best of condition
to work by the method of taking thin vertical cuts. The square produced
as follows: in the SE quarter the soil was similar to the subsoil in color which
was of a light brown or yellow color and with a high content of sand. There
were lighter streaks and blotches throughout this area, and as has been found
in most of the other squares, there was a small quantity of sand tempered fabric
impressed sherds in the top part of this soil just described. The NW portion of
the square had a concentration of the midden as is usually found in the main occupation.
The NW quarter of the square produced a good quantity of shell
tempered sherds. This area was screened but produced only sherds and a few
small animal bones. This deposit continued through the depth of the level and
was evident in the ground plan or horizontal profile at DD 6.0 though nearing
the termination of it.</p>
<p>The ground plan at DD 6.0 revealed what appeared to be several postmolds
in an arc-like pattern. Photographs, black and white and color were taken of this
ground plan. These areas which appeared to be postmolds were cross sectioned
and the cut was photographed in color. To date it is doubtful that they could
be postmolds for the following reasons: there were no definite lines to indicate
the post, the sand streaks were evident in the unbroken pattern of the rest of the
soil, the soil appeared to be stained, and in one of the patterns in question, the
stain was in a pattern similar to an outline of a postmold. In the others the
depth varied from less than a tenth of a foot to five tenths and they were in an
irregular shape in the cut or profile where it was cross sectioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3 id="c15">32R36, March 20, 1960</h3>
<p>From an aerial photograph of the site made in January, 1960, there appeared
to be several dark areas along the east line of the site. These could have been
damp spots or could have been patterns representing refuse pits, houses or some
other features. They were in a straight line and uniformly spaced. It was difficult
to locate the spot from the ground, but using photographs from two
angles, we were able to find the approximate location of one of these dark areas.
Then the grid system was staked out in this area and using 1 &times; 4 &times; 10 ft. boards
painted white and placed at designated squares the site was again photographed
from different angles and altitudes. Square 32R36 appeared to be within one of
the dark circles, which did not appear as clearly as in the first aerial photograph
for the site had been plowed in the meantime.</p>
<p>Charles Scheel and myself began work. The plowzone produced few potsherds
and bone (F. S. 388) and a number of bits of burned clay appeared in the
plowzone as well as the sherds. The first horizontal profile contained a considerable
amount of charcoal bits. The profile indicated changes of color in different
areas of the square but did not give any indication of a pit or postmolds or anything
that would indicate a feature to us. There was evidence of earthquake
disturbance on the west side of the square. There was a dark area on the
east side with considerable charcoal and burned bits of clay with numerous potsherds
and a fair amount of animal bone&mdash;quite suggestive of a refuse area. To
the south of this was an area of medium brown sandy soil with a bit of clay
mixed in but it contained little material.</p>
<p>The area to the west was of a lighter color and contained fewer charcoal
bits, but about as many potsherds and bone. On the west side of the square beginning
at the north end one foot east of the west wall, a vertical sand streak
one half inch wide, possibly earthquake disturbance, running to the west wall
four feet south of the north end, and another vertical sand streak two feet wide
running about four and one half feet south of the north end to the south wall
three feet east of the SW corner of the square.</p>
<p>In the NW quarter of the square Burial 38 was found. It was quite compact
and not articulated. Some of the bone had been burned and was in fragments.</p>
<p>In the NE quarter of the square and just north of Burial 38 was located
Burial 39. It too had been partially burned but the bones were more neatly
placed than Burial 38. The skull and parts of the other bones were not burned.
Both burials were photographed.</p>
<h3 id="c16">41R21, March 22, 1960</h3>
<p>Charles Scheel and myself began work this A.M. Plowzone removed and
potsherds etc., F. S. 400, were not too numerous in the plowzone. Also in the
plowzone were fragments of glass, bottles, chinaware and crockery. At one time
there was a house located some one hundred feet from this square, and this possibly
accounts for this disturbance. Also in the plowzone at the south center of
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the square were found fragments of a skull and fragments of a pottery vessel
(this bone fragment listed as Burial 40 and pottery fragments as F. S. 401, DD
4.4). The first horizontal profile at DD 4.5 produced a general overall color,
medium dark brown.</p>
<p>At this point being mostly out of the present plowzone level there was not
the clear cut undisturbed Indian deposit. There was a considerable amount of
charcoal bits and a few pieces of burned clay showing in the horizontal profile.</p>
<p>DD 4.5 to 5.0, potsherds, stone and bone, F. S. 402, for this level. Burial 40
was evident in this level and was determined to be head to north from other
bone fragments found. Recent disturbance was again noted in this level, the
presence of a shotgun shell base, pieces of glass, chinaware and nails. The nails
were in excellent condition.</p>
<p>An unidentified soft red sandstone object shaped somewhat like a boatstone,
F. S. 403, DD 4.9, was found. An area to six feet north of the SE stake running
to one foot east of the SW stake appeared to be undisturbed.</p>
<p>DD 5.0 to 5.5, NE corner at check for DD 5.5 appeared to be undisturbed
soil and nearing the color of the subsoil. Part of this level on west side toward
the south end of the square appeared to be recently disturbed but not as deep as
DD 5.5. Several charred poles appeared as noted on horizontal profile at DD 5.5.</p>
<p>DD 5.5 to 6.0. The soil began to change to the color of the subsoil at DD
6.0 in the NW corner. Further work revealed a fired clay floor, and outline of
same worked out as shown on horizontal profile (took photographs).</p>
<p>The fired clay floor did not cover the entire outline of the house pattern
and where the fired floor was missing, there was evidence of its having been there,
this evidence was on the west part of the house. Explanation of this evidence is
due to the soil color&mdash;where a piece of the fired floor was removed there was a
pink or red color indicating intense heat. The same color was found outside the
area of the fired floor as was noted under the piece of floor lifted. There was a
definite outline of the west edge of the fired floor and at the same level the soil
changed to subsoil west of the line indicating the floor area. There were no
postmolds to be seen. The soil color, as before mentioned, is an orange to yellow
or very light tan color and since this was built atop the subsoil the postmolds
should have been visible.</p>
<p>Evidently the debris had been removed if the house had burned, but there
was a small amount of charred poles sizes from .1 to .2 foot in diameter at the
northwest end of the pattern. The pattern at the west and north sides was in a
square arrangement. There was a depression in the fired floor and associated
with it was a pottery vessel, F. S. 406, and it was complete except for the top
part. Also in the depression was charcoal but no ashes. The color of the depression
indicated it was or had been used as a fireplace, Feature 22. The west and
northwest end of the square indicated the house was square or rectangular in
shape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3 id="c17">41R22, March 22, 1960</h3>
<p>The west 4 feet of this square was opened and the house presented a problem.
The fired floor as well as the color representing the soil under the fired
floor was not evident, but being careful, following the vertical profile we were
able to determine the approximate west line of the house. For safety&rsquo;s sake we
listed the east wall as indeterminate. There was no evidence to be seen of any
postmolds. The south end of the house pattern was in this same condition. Further
work on the adjoining squares produced another house. The house in 41R21
and 41R22 was partly under the house in 40R21, 40R22, 39R22, 39R21 and
39R22.</p>
<p>The preceding has been a selected sample of essentially unedited field notes
not including much detail and barely mentioning the carefully drawn maps, and
horizontal and vertical profiles that accompanied the written description. Profiles
showing soil color changes were done in color, using colored pencils in an
attempt to duplicate the colors observed. Photographs, both black and white
and color were taken whenever anything showed up of possible use for record
or interpretation. (The Editors).</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">EXCAVATIONS</span></h2>
<p>A north-south cross sectional profile along the R22 line shows a rise of 3.4
feet from the south base line to a point of maximum elevation some 400 feet
north. The midden deposit shows a corresponding increase in depth. The zero
base line was on the south end of the site in an area that appears to have been
destroyed by an early St. Francis River meander. Excavation was carried on from
this point to square 40R22, a distance of 400 feet north, but not to the northern
end of the site which is some distance beyond. The northern portion of the profile
indicated that this was an area of major house building activity while to the
south and just north of the area washed out by the St. Francis River meander
there is some indication of a court or open community center. The ancient river
meander was filled with a bluish sandy clay. This ends near stake 9R22 with a
datum elevation of 1.2 feet above the base line.</p>
<p>From 5 to 8R22 there was a sandy deposit below the plow line which probably
represents a deposit from standing water as the meander activity comes to a
stop and filling in became a slow silting process. From 8 to 17R22 there was a
thin hard-packed deposit from .2 to .3 feet in depth. Test pits through this section
yielded almost no archaeological material while just north of 17R22 the
midden deposit abruptly deepened. This area, almost 100 feet north-south, was
also seen on the east-west profile. It is this area that gives the impression of being
a plaza or community center (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>Starting just north of this open area there was a bank of clean sand and the
midden deposit below suddenly dipped downward until at 21R22 it was quite
pronounced with evidence of a sand boil. This disturbance was due to the New
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Madrid earthquake and can be clearly seen in many areas of this state. Here, the
evidence for land subsidence, along with large sand boils originating from considerable
depth, is clear. This earthquake evidence was no longer apparent north
of square 29R22 and the full undisturbed midden deposit of 1.5 foot depth gives
evidence of the Indian occupation. At square 40R22 the deposit was 1.8 feet deep
and it is at this point that houses 2 and 3 were found. The excavation was not
carried any farther north.</p>
<p>It is impossible to see absolute stratigraphic separation of archaeological
materials in an inspection of cross sectional profiles. There was a general feeling
among the excavators that the sand tempered sherds were more numerous in the
lower levels but no clear association can be made. In several instances sand
tempered sherds were found in the underlying subsoil but never were any shell
tempered sherds so found.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the firebasins and houses built on subsoil had only shell
tempered pottery associations so it must be concluded that the people responsible
for this pottery lived here at a time when the midden was non-existent. It
is tempting to argue that evidence of an earlier occupation by people making
the sand tempered pottery and perhaps dart points was washed away in some
series of floods sweeping the camp-site clean except for a few minor items left
behind in the newly silted sands. The earthquakes of recent times have played
their part in reshifting the materials in this deposit thereby completely confusing
such stratigraphic picture as may once have been present.</p>
<p>Two east-west cross sectional profiles are available for study, one at the
northern end of the site and the other toward the south end. The northern portion
of the deposit can be seen along the 32 line starting at the levee at stake
32R2 with a deposit depth of 2.2 feet. From this point to 32R10 the top of the
subsoil was quite irregular and this irregularity is apparent on the surface of the
land as the midden deposit follows the irregularities of the subsoil. It is probable
that this is the result of the New Madrid earthquakes.</p>
<p>It was in this area that the presence of sand tempered pottery in the subsoil
was first noted. A number of burials were encountered in this section of the
excavation. From 23R10 to 23R16 the drainage ditch has removed all archaeological
materials. At stake 32R19 the deposit was 1.6 feet in depth and continued
to stake 32R25 where it was 2.2 feet deep. This full depth of deposit continued
to 32R28 where it started to taper out until at stake 32R39, it was only .2 feet
deep. While levee building has destroyed the western edge of the site we know
that it was at least 400 feet wide. This would indicate a town four or more acres
in extent.</p>
<p>An east-west profile was also drawn along the R17 line from the levee at
stake 17R5 where the deposit is quite thin to 17R39 where it almost tapers out.</p>
<p>At 17R8 the depth was 1.4 feet while immediately across the drainage ditch
the hard packed dark band becomes apparent with little or no deposit either
above or below it. This hard packed area runs eastward for about 100 feet to
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
17R30. At 17R32 the deposit was again 2.2 feet in depth but this thinned out
rapidly at 17R32-39 as the eastern limits of the village was reached.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">MATERIAL CULTURE</span></h2>
<h4 id="c20">Pottery</h4>
<p>Pottery from the Lawhorn site represents two distinct traditions. By far the
biggest is the standard shell tempered ware of this area, while a minor type is a
sand tempered ware present as a plain, cord marked and textile marked series.
The total sherd count was 10,423 of all types of which 9461 or 91% were of the
familiar Mississippian shell tempered types and 962 or 9% were of the sand tempered
series.</p>
<h5 id="c21"><i>Sand Tempered</i></h5>
<p>The sand tempered series are summarized in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. Similar plain and
cord marked sherds (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>) have been called Barnes, (Williams, 1956, p. 204).
The textile marked sherds can now be added to this series (Figs. <a href="#fig6">6</a>-<a href="#fig7">7</a>). The cord
marked sherds ranged from very coarse to quite fine markings, but definitely
favored the coarse variety. The 534 textile marked sherds yielded 293 (55%) that
were clear enough to identify the weave. These show the preponderate of simple
twined textiles.</p>
<p>It is of interest that the simple twined textiles seem to have a diagonal weft,
or at least, in the finished piece as it was applied to wet clay vessels, to show
this diagonal weave characteristic. The twisting and twining of the cords however
seem to be typically simple twined (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>).</p>
<p>Edward G. Scully and Stephen Williams first named the Barnes series while
working for the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Central Mississippi Valley survey on
Barnes ridge in southeastern Missouri. Williams later defined the type (Williams,
1956, Ph.D. Dissertation) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is a finely tempered plain ware in which the sand particles, although
numerous in some specimens are quite small. The texture is such that in
running one&rsquo;s fingers over the surface the sandy nature of the temper is immediately
noticed. This description of the temper and texture holds for all
the Barnes wares. The shapes are similar to those of the Baytown Plain (Philips,
et. al., 1951: 77-78). Barnes Cord Marked: This Cord Marked variety goes
hand-in-hand in distribution with the Plain ware, and like it, resembles its
clay tempered counterpart, Mulberry Creek Cord Marked, and there is occasionally
a folded or added rim strip.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sand tempered sherds at Lawhorn answer to this description, but the
question of vessel shape is left unanswered. One possible basal sherd was cord
marked and conical in shape. The characteristic of a folded rim in the cord marked
group was not identified in the Lawhorn series.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Speaking of sand tempered wares generally and fabric impressed specifically,
as an early Woodland movement into the south from the north, Griffin and
Sears indicate a relatively early period within the total ceramic horizon of the
southeast. In most areas the textile marked tradition dies out by Middle Woodland
times. Williams&rsquo; description would seem to equate Barnes Cord Marked
with Mulberry Creek Cord Marked, which reached its peak during a Middle
Woodland period although also present at an earlier time.</p>
<p>All this is of some help in establishing a chronological position for the sand
tempered series within the known cultural sequences of this region. It might be
construed as adding strength to the belief that there was a considerable time
span between the sand tempered and shell tempered wares of the Lawhorn site,
and suggests an Early Woodland period of occupation with the sand tempered
pottery and the assorted dart points as the only remaining evidence of the early
period.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a Bell Plain Type is so tentative as to be questionable. The
few sherds so classified are better considered as a refinement of Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry
Plain. This viewpoint receives additional support with the statement that there
was considerable variation in the workmanship shown on Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry ware,
some being well polished and with a finer shell temper. Some sherds that were
first thought to be clay tempered were later determined to be shell tempered
with the shell leached out. There was almost no lip decoration in the form of
nicking or notching. The standard treatment was simply a rounded lip smoothed
to the inside and outside vessel walls.</p>
<h5 id="c23"><i>Appendages</i></h5>
<p>Handles and lugs accounted for 1.4% of the sherd count. Of the identifiable
pieces and whole specimens, there are 17 lugs, 2 loop handles, 2 intermediate
and 49 strap handles. The lugs showed considerable variation and specialization
which may be a local development. The Monette lug, as this local type has been
called, is basically a U shaped applique with the ends pointing downward (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>;1-2).
One example was well squared and gives the appearance of an old European
churn handle. According to Nash, the cup lug is this same form inverted
and these do occasionally turn up in less exaggerated form on the Lower St.
Francis River sites. Eight of the lugs are rounded and are molded to the lip.
Two are effigy tail lugs one of which was riveted to the vessel rim (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>;4).
The other has a node in the center, outlined by an incised line. Two lugs are
rounded and bifurcated. (<a href="#table3">Table 3</a>).</p>

<p>The loop handle was uncommon and quite small. One was made up of two
strands or coils of clay loosely twisted to form the loop. The other is a simple
loop that rises above the lip. Both attach to and are possibly riveted to the lip.
They attach from lip to upper shoulder area.</p>
<p>Two handles are intermediate between loop and strap. One is attached below
the lip. The other is attached at the lip and has a node at the top of the
handle.</p>
<p>By far the most common appendage form was the strap handle and these
were first divided into three sub groups based on profile shape to show attachment
to the vessel wall (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>;6, 7, and 8). These handle forms, like many of
the lug forms, show a high percentage of attachment to the vessel body wall by
means of riveting (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>;3). They are molded to the rim. Of the total of 51
handles, 49 were strap handles. The handles vary from angular to curved in
cross-section (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>;6, 7, 8). These are all simple, unmodified strap handles that
have the following variations; 4 are parallel sided, 2 expand toward the lip attachment,
1 expands toward the shoulder attachment and four are undetermined
in outline. One has an extension of a notched lip decoration across the top of
the handle at the lip attachment.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight handles are bifurcated by nodes or an elevation of the sides to
form a ridge on the outer edges and sometimes to give the appearance of a
groove down the center (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). Often there are ear-like projections on either
side, 20 occurring at the top of the strap, but eight lower down toward midpoint
(<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>) are less common. All are parallel sided and join at or just below
the lip and attach to the shoulder. All seem to be riveted to the shoulders,
but molded to the lip. One is angular and has an applique transverse ridge in
the center of the handle (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>
<p>Two strap handles have three fillets below the handle and extending from
it; one on each side and one from the center of the handle. One of the two appears
to have a small raised node on one side (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>; Row 2, right).</p>
<p>A similar handle has only two fillets extending below it. The handle edges
are raised; the fillet appears to extend the raised edges onto the shoulders. The
top of the handle is flattened and vertically perforated through the flat portion
(<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>; Row 2, left).</p>
<p>Another handle, similar in profile to that previously described, does not
have the added fillets, but has the flattened top and vertical perforation. The
handle is on a rim sherd decorated with a single U-shaped horizontal line along
the neck.</p>

<p>Two handles have longitudinal grooves as decorations. One has three U-shaped
incisions or grooves and the two nodes at the upper end. The other has
2 single central grooves (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>; Row 1, left).</p>
<p>Three sherds with handles have been classed tentatively at Matthews Incised
(Griffin, 1952, Fig. 122;d). One example shows a hole through the flat
upper portion of the strap and this was done while the clay was still plastic
(<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). Two sherds have bifurcated handles, the other has been described as a
loop handle. There are two pieces of fillet-tail handles and pieces of five others.
These were not identifiable as to type.</p>
<h4 id="c24">Effigies</h4>
<p>Five modeled effigy pottery decorations or attachments were found in the
general excavations. Two were painted while the other three were of Neeley&rsquo;s
Ferry paste. One was a human effigy of the full face with a rounded open mouth,
quite large and prominent nose and eyes defined only by overhanging brows
(<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>). The hair arrangement was similar to bangs indicated along the line of
the top of the forehead. One of the painted heads was of a bird, perhaps turkey,
showing a trace of red, white and black paint. This could possibly be a negative
painted sherd but the evidence was not conclusive. The other painted effigy was
Old Town Red and apparently represented some bird form. The other two forms
may have been bats and seem to have been facing inside the vessel.</p>
<p>Almost the entire shell tempered pottery complex is of Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain
with an extensive use of strap handles on large jars, many of which were of six
to eight gallons capacity (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>, center). These handles were normally paired
and on opposite sides of the vessel. Decorated types are extremely rare, in all
less than 2% of the sherds. Of these Old Town Red comprises more than 50%.</p>
<p>Add the small percentage of Carson Red on Buff and Nodena Red and
White and these account for over 60% of all decorated types (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>). Of the
balance, only a sprinkling of incised types, one possibly Wallace Incised, are
present (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>). These low totals are possibly accounted for by considering
them trade pieces rather than local techniques, or perhaps outside ideas of decoration
that had not become fully accepted. One form of local decoration which
shows an increase when complete vessels are considered is the pushing out of
small areas around the pot to form rounded nodes or projections. Associated
with some of these large jars was a crude incising around the shoulder area which
was a very poor imitation of the Barton Incised of the St. Francis area. This is
very suggestive of a new idea in decoration with little real interest in technical
achievement. That these people were skilled enough in ceramics to have done
fine work is attested to by the elaboration of workmanship in the strap handle
assemblage.</p>

<h5 id="c25">Vessel Forms</h5>
<p>It was possible to identify vessel forms from 3.4% of the shell tempered
sherds collected. These forms are listed and their frequency of occurrence shown
in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>, Column I. The most common forms were the wide mouthed bowl
of small to medium size and wide mouthed jars which showed extreme variation
in size from small jars of perhaps a pint capacity to very large ones of several
gallons capacity (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). Water bottles were a very uncommon form of vessel
if judged from the sherd collection.</p>
<p>Among the complete vessels recovered the water bottle was over 50% of the
total while the sherd collection yielded only 1.3 of this class (<a href="#table4">Table 4</a>). This is a
strong example of a mortuary vessel form which found little use in the daily
domestic scene. The water bottle at Lawhorn was apparently not a vessel of
utility to the living but only to the dead.</p>

<p>The vessel forms found at Lawhorn can be described as bowls, jars and water
bottles.</p>
<h6 id="c26">BOWLS:</h6>
<p>Three pottery bowls have almost vertical sides with flat bases (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>;1, 2, 3)
while one very crude vessel with vertical sides is round bottomed. Three
of the bowls are quite shallow, approaching the plate form but lacking the flattened
plate rim (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>;5). The plate forms identified for Lawhorn were from
the sherd collection and these represent 1.8% of the identified shapes. Four other
bowls are small round-bottomed pots typical of the Memphis-St. Francis Mississippian
groups.</p>
<p>The only recovered vessel showing painted decoration were two shallow
bowls. One of these was Carson Red on Buff slipped on both the inside and
outside surface (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>;1). It is a very shallow bowl with a diameter of 3 cm.
and a depth of 8 cm. The lip was flat and scalloped around the outer edge. The
interior had been painted with a red design composed of four large triangles
drawn as opposing parts so that on two the apex was up while on the other pair
it was down.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h6 id="c27">JARS:</h6>
<p>Jars range in size from small vessels of perhaps a pint capacity to vessels of
several gallons. Only the smaller jars occurred as burial furniture, however. The
larger jars have been reconstructed from sherds found in refuse pits and so are
part of the domestic complex. Most of the jars have some form of strap handle
and seem to have been the only vessel form decorated by incising or by punching
out nodes. Such examples of incising as are evidenced in this collection are
very poorly executed (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>
<h6 id="c28">WATER BOTTLES:</h6>
<p>This vessel form was very largely a mortuary form with little apparent
value on the domestic scene. This is particularly true of the long, narrow necked
vessels. These often showed specialized or individualized treatment by the addition
of ridges or collars of clay at the base of the neck, occasionally at the midpoint
of the body (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>;2) and by the variation of treatment of the base so
that in this collection no one form could be called standard. There was a tendency,
however to flatten and then indent the bottom of the bottles. Other basal
embellishments included a narrow truncated base and angular forms (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>;1, 2, 3, 4).
Our most interesting bottle was found on the floor of house three (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>;5).
It was crudely made but uniquely shaped&mdash;reminiscent almost of a Grecian
urn. An elongated globular body with a short and narrow neck. Strap handles

<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">DESCRIPTION AND COMPARISON</span></h2>
<p>As a check against interpretation and as a means of getting an idea of possible
relationships of the Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain vessels found elsewhere, each vessel
was taken up separately. The procedure used consisted first in describing the
vessel, and secondly any comparisons that could be made.</p>
<p>The vessels were roughly classified and then evaluated in order. First was a
broken water bottle that has had an angular ring base which has a fillet at the
base of the neck. The body is sub-globular, tending toward carination but not
enough so that there was agreement that it is carinated (No. 75 found with
burial 21). A similar vessel is shown by Griffin (1952, p. 320) and is identified
with the New Madrid focus. Griffin (1952, plate 124K) shows a vessel that is
similar coming from the St. Francis area. Williams (1956) in his thesis, has included
the New Madrid Focus in the Cairo Lowland which he notes as a Phase.
Another similar vessel is a Neely&rsquo;s Ferry Plain bottle coming from Monette,
Arkansas (Phillips, et al., 1951, Fig. 105, F). It seems from the references that
this particular vessel is relatively typical of the St. Francis Malden Plain area but
could have some relationship to the Cairo Lowland area.</p>
<p>Another water bottle has an annular ring base that is perforated (No. 189,
burial 35). The body is sub-globular and is definitely carinated. The neck is long
and flares at the opening and the vessel surface is burnished. It is classed as
Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain due to the prevalence of large flakes of shell which show on
the surface. It is comparable to a vessel figured in Phillips, et. al., (1951, Fig.
103f) noted as a Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry or Bell Plain bottle that comes from the St.
Francis River near Monette, Arkansas.</p>
<p>The next bottle (F. S. 60 with burial 17) has a globular body, a long neck
and flares slightly at the opening. The base is flat. It is a Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain
vessel. The overall bottle shape seems to be a generalized one and none could
be found with which it compared very thoroughly. A similar Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry
Plain water bottle (F. S. 88 with burial 24) also has an almost globular body
with a flat base but this vessel has a fillet at the base of the neck and the neck
is slightly flaring. A vessel somewhat similar to this is figured on plate 3 of
Potter and Evers (1880) in the center at the top of the page. The vessel shown
came from southeastern Missouri. A broken water bottle (F. S. 406, house 2),
was associated with the fireplace in house two. It compares very favorably with
specimen number 60 but is somewhat carinated similar to specimen number 75.
The neck is missing. A Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain long necked water bottle (F. S. 81,
burial 23), has a globular body but has a flat base which extends from the body
and is similar in external appearance to an annular ring base. The neck contracts
toward the opening and has a slightly smaller diameter at the opening. The body
shape and base are somewhat similar to Keno Trailed shown in the Belcher
Mound report plate 112 A through D (Webb, 1959). The neck shape is similar
to Sanders Plain (Suhm, et. al., 1954). The neck shape also approaches that of
the Spiro Engraved (Baerreis, 1957, pl. 64, A, D, F, G and H). However, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
neck does not contract as much at the opening. It appears that this neck shape
may be derived from or at least be related to the neck shapes in the Caddo area.</p>
<p>A broken water bottle or a jar (FS 118, burial 27) is not readily identifiable
as to exact form. The body of the vessel is sub-globular and the base is somewhat
rounded. Perhaps it was a short necked vessel. A short necked (FS 76,
burial 22) Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain jar is broken. It is a sub-globular shaped vessel
with a flat base that is very similar in body shape to vessel number 60. Another
short necked water bottle (FS 39, burial 15) has a globular body with a flattened
and depressed base. This compares with a Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry vessel (Phillips, et. al.,
1951: Fig. 104A) from Cross county, Arkansas. There is some uncertainty concerning
the type base on this vessel. Another specimen (FS 191, burial 34) is a
short necked water bottle that has a sub-globular body and a depressed base. It
is similar to field specimen 39 but the body is not quite as globular.</p>
<p>A very unusual vessel, also Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain (FS 418), was found associated
with house 3. It is a water bottle form but has two strap handles (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>;5).
It is somewhat similar to a vessel from Cross county, Arkansas (Phillips,
et. al., 1951: Fig. 93D). The latter has a much wider opening and the body is
much more globular.</p>
<p>The next group of vessels consists of plates and bowls. An Old Town Red
plate or bowl (FS 119, burial 27) is painted both inside and out. It has a flat
disk bottom. The one vessel that it seems to compare with in general shape is a
Sanders Plain (Suhm, et. al., 1954; pl. 60, D) which is of a different temper but
is partly red filmed. A plate or shallow bowl has approximately the same shape
as that of the Old Town Red but is Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain (FS 313, burial 37). It
seems to be in the same tradition because the lip is flattened in the same manner
as the Old Town Red plate. The rims on these plates are indistinct, grading into
the bowl wall. The other plate form (FS 145, house 1) is not quite as well done
as the two previously described but is approximately the same shape and has the
same characteristics. It is also a Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain plate and is much like the
two preceding except it is larger than the others. An example of a plate that is
somewhat similar in shape and which is red filmed or red painted, and thus an
Old Town Red vessel, is shown in Evers (1880: pl. 17, Fig. 173).</p>
<p>Bowls are the next group of vessels. One is a shallow bowl (FS 25 burial 7)
of Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain ware. It has a rounded lip. It compares very closely with
two vessels from Cross County, Arkansas (Phillips, et. al., 1951: Fig. 100 F and
G). Another shallow bowl (FS 104, burial 25) is of the same type and general
shape. A slightly different bowl (FS 90, burial 24) (<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>) has notches around
the edge of the lip giving it a pie-crust effect and it is much the same as one
from Mississippi county, Arkansas (Evers, 1880, Fig. 100 F and G).</p>
<p>Straight sided bowls (FS 35 burial 12 and FS 61 burial 17) of Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry
Plain ware have relatively straight sides, rounded bases and rounded lips and
compare to Sanders Plain (Suhm, et. al., 1954: pl. 60 B, D, E). The bowls are
similar to one that is smaller in size that was found in a house on the Lofton
Site I, 23SN42, in the Table Rock Reservoir, Missouri (Chapman, personal
communication).</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 16. Pottery Vessels with Burial 24</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Two bowls, marked as field specimen 190, occurred with burial 33. The
field notes mention only one bowl and no picture was made of the burial. One
bowl is plain (Suhm, et. al., 1954: pl. 60B), and the other is straight sided of
Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain paste which has a series of nodes placed opposite each other,
four on three sides and three on one side (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>;3). No vessels could be found
that were comparable.</p>
<p>A Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain bowl (FS 36 burial 12) has an incurved side and a
somewhat rounded, almost flat base. It compares in shape with a Barkman Engraved
bowl shown in plate 4,C (Suhm, et. al., 1954). Also similar in shape is
F in the same plate. Several of the engraved types from the Caddoan area have
somewhat similarly shaped bowls represented within them and it seems very possible
that this bowl shape derives from that general area.</p>
<p>A small bowl (FS 26) is Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain. It is relatively deep and steep
sided with a rounded bottom. It was unassociated with any feature. It is roughly
made and nothing could be found to compare it with.</p>
<p>Two jars of the same type but differing in size are of importance in the interpretation.
One is a large jar (FS 419, house 3) of globular shape with a recurved
rim. The other is a miniature jar of the same type (FS 89, burial 24)
(<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a> right). Both have two bifurcated strap handles. The large vessel seems
to be the standard utility ware of the Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain and of the widespread
so-called Mississippi Plain. A vessel very similar is shown in a group of shell
tempered ones from Middle Mississippi features at Moundville (Griffin, 1952;
Fig. 151: 4). The small vessel associated with the burial was probably made specifically
as a grave offering rather than for utilitarian purposes. This tends to support
the suggestion made earlier that the whole vessels found with burials are
representative of mortuary customs rather than a true representation of the pottery
characteristically used domestically.</p>
<p>A decorated pottery vessel (FS 426) was found associated with house 3. It
is Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry paste, has a bifurcated handle and has a decoration that is a
series of incised half moon designs on the shoulder, each of three lines similar
to Matthews Incised decoration. The incising is crude on the vessel and it is
suspected that this might be an influence from the Cairo Lowland area where
Matthews Incised is much better done and is more prominent. Another Neeley&rsquo;s
Ferry Plain jar (FS 13) with the bifurcated strap handles has a design on it that
is similar to the Matthews Incised and it also has a series of punch and bosses
associated with the design. A vessel similar to this is shown in Porter and Evers
(1880; pl. 12, center right). On this same plate are two other vessels with the
punch and boss impressions both of which are middle Mississippi types from
southeastern Missouri. The incised decoration and bosses are also shown on vessels
found at the Matthews site (Walker and Adams 1941; p. 116, pl. 15, A and
B).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>There are three other vessels from the site. One is a water bottle (FS 2,
burial 1) which has a raised portion rather than a fillet at the base of the neck
and which has a straight long neck slightly tapering toward the opening. Similar
to it is a long necked Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain vessel (FS 125, burial 28) with a
carination which is partly filleted. The base is flat. The last of the three is one
with a cut base. It is a relatively long straight necked water bottle. There is no
information concerning its location on the site.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">SUMMARY OF THE POTTERY</span></h2>
<p>The sherd analysis gives a picture of the domestic ceramic complex. A study
of the whole vessels indicates the mortuary wares and shapes used by these people.
That these are not the same as the domestic styles is clearly shown from the
data in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. The 31 complete or restorable vessels from Lawhorn constituted
76% mortuary types. The other 24% came from house floors and refuse pits to
give a picture of the domestic wares. Except for the one unusual strap handled
water bottle, these were bowls and jars of assorted size. While some shallow
bowls and a few plate forms were identified from sherds no complete vessels of
these types were found on the domestic scene. Shallow bowls in their complete
state were entirely within the mortuary list of finds. The difference in vessel
form as indicated by potsherds from the domestic complex and whole vessels
for this mortuary complex is tabulated in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. In column III only those vessels
found with burials have been tabulated to give a more precise picture of the
mortuary ceramic complex. This will point out how nearly the complete vessel
inventory is indicative of the mortuary class. In addition to vessel type it will be
noted that there is an impressive rise in the number of vessels with flat bases in
the mortuary vessel group as compared to the evidence from the potsherd collection.</p>
<p>It becomes clear that while complete pottery vessels present an accurate
ceramic picture it is a specialized one and different from that of the sherd count
analysis. The difference may be a direct reflection of different segments of the
village life pattern, the funerary customs on the one hand and home life on the
other.</p>
<p>Other interpretations might be made on the same pottery and potsherd collection.
Variation of mortuary wares between major towns could easily exist
while utility wares of each followed a more widespread and fundamental pattern
so that little variation would be apparent between two such towns if judged
from potsherds, but a pronounced difference if judged by complete vessels.</p>
<p>With the early type pottery, or with one assumed to be early, the conclusion
was reached that the best way to describe the sand tempered wares would
be to call them &ldquo;sand tempered plain,&rdquo; &ldquo;sand tempered cord marked&rdquo; and &ldquo;sand
tempered fabric impressed.&rdquo; The sand tempered plain is similar to Thomas Plain
in the lower valley (Phillips, et. al., 1951; 141-2) and to Barnes Plain in the
Cairo Lowland (Williams, 1956; 204). The sand tempered cord marked is similar
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
to the Blue Lakes Cord marked in the Lower Valley (Phillips, et. al., 1951: 142-4)
and to Barnes Cord marked in the Cairo Lowland (Williams, 1956: 204). The
fabric impressed sand tempered sherds are similar to the Twin Lakes Fabric Impressed
(Phillips, et. al., 1951: 144-5) in the lower valley and similar to the
fabric impressed occurring in the Barnes series in the Cairo Lowland. It does not
seem advisable to name the sand tempered sherds that are from the Lawhorn
site as separate types. Further, the distribution of the Lower Valley types Thomas
Plain, Blue Lake Cord marked and Twin Lakes Fabric Impressed appear to be
too far away to equate them with the Lawhorn series on the basis of the sample
at Lawhorn. The same can be said for the Barnes series.</p>
<p>The pottery was first classified with the aid of books and advice of several
archaeologists. Before publication a check of the pottery was made resulting in
the re-evaluation of a few of the types. Most important was the declassification
of incised sherds other than Wallace Incised. Further, the painted wares were
classed as Carson Red on Buff and Nodena Red and White only.</p>
<p>A search of the literature on southeastern pottery was done to try to find
the time period in which the Lawhorn pottery fitted. According to Phillips,
Ford and Griffin (1951: 132-133), the Carson Red on Buff and Nodena Red and
White are included under the term Avenue Painted and this ware extends into
period B about half way. Wallace Incised, although it is primarily a late type, in
period A, has been found on sites extending all the way to the end of period C.
The other incised types are somewhat similar to Barton Incised and Kent Incised,
but neither type could be definitely identified. Barton Incised has been
found in the St. Francis area on sites extending back almost to Period D, and
Kent Incised occurs at least halfway into Period B. Due to the small number
of sherds and uncertainty of identification of type all of the incised sherds except
Wallace were thrown into an unclassified category.</p>
<p>On the basis of the pottery types, the most predominant being Neeley&rsquo;s
Ferry Plain which starts at approximately the beginning of Period B or Period
C and maintains this maximum popularity to the end of Period B, it was decided
that this site probably falls in the latter part of Period B.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h4 id="c31">Pottery Disks</h4>
<p>These were quite common on the site, particularly in areas of house concentration.
A total of 33 either whole or fragmentary specimens were catalogued.
Of these, six were the plain disks so common to Mississippian sites (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>:1)
while 27 were perforated. All of the perforated specimens had a hole through
the center of the disk and may well have been spindle whorls (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>:2). These
ranged in size from 3 to 8 cm. in diameter. Nine of the spindle whorl type disks
had well smoothed edges while the remaining edges were either roughly smoothed
or unmodified after breaking. All of them were of Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain except
one made from an Old Town Red sherd. The drilled disks were most commonly
found in association with the houses, although several specimens were
found in refuse pits. Four of the perforated disks had more than one hole drilled
in them (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>:3). One had two completed holes with a third just started on
one surface. Another example had a central hole and another drilling had been
started from both sides but not carried to completion (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>:4).</p>
<p>In eleven of the drilled disks the holes were at an angle, probably due to
improper drilling, the angle drilling from one side being necessary to meet the
perforation from the opposite side.</p>
<p>There were six unperforated disks which ranged in size from 2 to 6 cm. in
diameter. Two of these had smoothed edges while the others had been roughly
shaped only. The smallest of these disks had a smoothed edge with a groove incised
into it.</p>
<p>Seven examples of drilled pottery were found of which two are perforated
rims, the holes being drilled after firing. One piece has been perforated several
times. One of the drilled rimsherds, (FS 124) was on the chest of burial 28. It
may have been used as a pendant. Another specimen, (FS 225) had three incompleted
holes as well as the perforation. One perforated sherd was Old Town
Red, another sand-tempered cord-marked and the rest were Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain.</p>
<h4 id="c32">Projectile Points</h4>
<p>The projectile points found at the Lawhorn site presented a variety of forms
and sizes. The wide range of types seemed at first very difficult to explain. Further,
pictures and written definitions of points were very hard to reconcile with
the specimens at hand. An example of this difficulty was a point that seemed to
answer all the requirements of the Motley type (Ford, Phillips, Haag 1955; p.
129), but which failed the test of visual examination by Ford. How many of the
others originally typed would fail a similar visual examination test is open to
question. Therefore, a separation of like with like form was made and unless a
fair number of a particular type was present, no certain identification of type was
made.</p>
<p>There was a total of 95 identifiable points of which 84% were surface finds.
Only 4% were found in the general midden, but 12% were at the very base of
the deposit. These points were first separated into 26 types, however eighteen of
these were represented by one or, at most, two specimens. Only eight of the
types were present in sufficient numbers to represent a local industry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="799" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 17. Pottery Disks</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>In theory, at least, points found in repetitive numbers should represent a
local industry and so aid in identifying their makers. The one-of-a-kind types
would likely represent individual variation, trade, or the result of some Indian&rsquo;s
collecting habits.</p>
<p>All of the projectile points except one which appears to be missing were
separated according to the characteristics of size, shape and general process of
manufacture. The 95 projectile points were placed into four major groups and a
number of smaller units.</p>
<p>One general arrowhead type seemed to be characteristic and made up more
than a third of the total number of points from the site. These were 34 corner
notched points with straight or rounded bases that varied in length from 44 mm.
to 22 mm. and in width measured at the shoulders 11 to 18 mm. (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>;1-3).
There is a rather great range in thickness due to the fact that some of the stone
was of poor quality and could not be thinned properly. The usual thickness was
2 to 5 mm. This particular point type is, in general, similar to the Scallorn type
(Bell, 1960; 84, pl. 42). It also compares fairly well with the points that come
from the Matthews site and similar sites in the Cairo lowland area. It is approximately
the same as the Table Rock Corner Notched arrowhead from the Table
Rock area southwestern Missouri (Bray, 1956, Fig. 18, Rows 4-5, and p. 126). A
secondary type that occurs with this and which is of some probable importance
is made up of ten specimens. These have a relatively straight stem but otherwise
are very similar to the major point type (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>;4). The points are similar to
the Bonham points (Bell, 1960, 10 pl. 5). The dimensions on these points are
as follows. The length ranges from 27 to 38 mm. and the width ranges from 12
to 19 mm.; the thickness is on the average 5 to 6 mm.</p>
<p>Probably associated with these two types and considered to be a part of the
projectile point complex of the Mississippi occupation is a small ovoid type
made up of seventeen specimens some of which may have been blank forms
since they do not appear to be finished (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>;1). The range in length of
these specimens is from 22 to 37 mm. Thickness ranging from 4 to 8 mm varies
considerably probably due to the fact that some are blank forms rather than
finished products. Width at the base which is, for the most part, the widest
position of the points varies from 14 to 20 mm. These points are somewhat
similar to the Catan points, (Bell, 1958; 14 pl. 7). The Catan points range from
500 to 800 A.D. according to Bell&rsquo;s compilations. The Lawhorn specimens
are also similar in some respects to Young points (Bell, 1960; 100, pl. 50).
Young points supposedly range from 1200 to 1500 A.D. They also compare rather
closely with ovate forms, Category &ldquo;O,&rdquo; found abundantly only in the late marginal
Mississippi Complex at the Rice Site (Bray, 1956, Fig. 13, and p. 79).</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>There are a few triangular points that may be of some diagnostic value. One
group of three are concave based triangular points and are relatively large in size.
The one nearly complete specimen is 38 mm. long and 13 wide (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>;3).
These perhaps can be compared with the Maude point (Bell 1958; 48, pl 24).
They also might be comparable with the Fresno points (Bell, 1960; 44, pl. 22).
However, these points seem to be much shorter than the Maude variety and it
is probable that those found on the Lawhorn site are more comparable with the
Maude if with either of the two. The Maude points supposedly date between
1200 and 1500 A.D. The Fresno points are thought to date from 800 to 900 A.D.
along to 1600 A.D.</p>
<p>There are also two triangular points with straight base and these are not
very comparable to any others except the general Mississippian type (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>;5).
One triangular form is very long, serrated (<a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a>;4) and is strikingly similar
to the Fort Ancient point (Bell, 1960; 40, pl. 20), which supposedly dates
between 1200 and 1600 A.D. The length of this point is 46 mm. and the width
is 13 mm. One other point compares favorably with some that occur in the
Table Rock Reservoir area in southwestern Missouri associated with the late
complex which includes shell tempered pottery. It is a side notched variety with
a straight base and is 41 mm. long and 14 mm. wide (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>;6). The length
width proportions are similar to those of the most prominent arrowhead types
on the site. Thus, it may have been made by someone on the site.</p>
<p>The preceding types seem to form a general complex that is associated primarily
with the Mississippian occupation and there is no indication that there
has been any great deal of influence in the area except from the same directions
(North and South) that were noted in regard to the pottery. The Scallorn point
type is similar to those from the Cairo lowland area and the Bonham is similar
to those from the Caddo area from the south. It is expected that both are good
Malden Plain, St. Francis River area types.</p>
<p>One other type might possibly be associated with the Mississippian occupation
and it is one that can be classed as Gary (Bell, 1958; 28 pl. 14). There are
four specimens (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>;1). Gary is supposed to date somewhere between 2000
B.C. to 600 A.D. but the evidence in the Table Rock area indicates that this
probably dates more nearly between 1000 A.D. and 1500 A.D. (Marshall, 1958).
The fact that the Gary type has been found in association with earlier periods
elsewhere makes it questionable to place it with the Mississippian occupation
here. It should be pointed out that it might be associated with the Mississippian
component for the type was definitely associated with the latest occupation in
the Table Rock area on upper White River.</p>
<p>The prominent type that seems to be associated with the earliest occupation
or the component associated with the sand tempered pottery on the site is a relatively
small dart point that is a stemmed form with a convex base and has little
or no shoulder (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>,2-5). The range in size is from 38 mm. to 51 mm. long
and 19 to 27 mm. wide. They are relatively thick (6 to 12 mm.) points, and
there are seven represented from the site.</p>

<br /><i>(1. Gary. 2-5. Unclassified)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>There are no other main groupings but there were a number of points about
the same size that could not be readily classified (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>;1-2). One in this
group is very similar to the Hardin point (Bell, 1960; 56, pl. 28) for it is beveled,
serrated, and has the correct shape but it is much smaller than the Hardin
points usually are (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>;3). This is not thought to be a Hardin point but is
perhaps in the same general tradition. There are two relatively large points that
are somewhat similar to the Burkett points and these may have some association
with the main ones from the site (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>;6). One point (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>;4) is
comparable to the Motley (Bell, 1958; 62, 131) which supposedly dates between
1300 and 200 B.C. A projectile point similar in type to Snyder (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>;5) was
missing from the collections when they were restudied. Another point (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>;7)
compares very favorably with the Uvalde (Bell, 1960; 92, p. 146), which supposedly
dates somewhere between 4000 and 1000 B.C.</p>
<p>It is very probable that some of the early points were picked up by the people
making the sand tempered pottery. For that matter they may have been
picked up by the later occupants, the Mississippi people. Certainly, it is felt that
these cannot be used for dating the early occupation on the site. There is no assurance,
for example, that the site was not used by people earlier than the time
of the sand tempered pottery. There is no evidence from stratification or superposition
from the excavations, that indicated more than two occupations of the
site.</p>
<p>The points that did not seem to have like members present were placed in
a general unclassified category and some of these have been illustrated in case
they might have some significance that would aid in placing the early or the late
components on the site.</p>
<h4 id="c33">Other Chipped Stone Artifacts</h4>
<p>Chipped stone tools were relatively uncommon at Lawhorn and are typified
in <a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a>. Number 1 and 2 are unifacial thumb nail scrapers. Number 3 is a
reworked projectile point while numbers 4 and 5, are fine pointed drills or
scrapers. Number 6 is a graver.</p>
<p>One large tool showed a good work polish and also indications that it had
been resharpened (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>;7). It was 7 cm. wide and 15.5 cm. long. There were
several flint fragments showing a high degree of work polish which came from
similar type tools.</p>
<p>Two chipped and polished celts were found. One of these was 3 cm. wide
in the center and 2.4 cm. at the bit. It was 7.5 cm. long but broken so that the
true length could only be estimated at perhaps 10 cm. This was a chisel type of
tool. The second specimen was made by removing large flakes over two faces to
give a crude hand axe type of specimen 8 cm. &times; 4.5 cm. &times; 2 cm. thick. Work
polish was evident on the highest portions of the surface.</p>
<h4 id="c34">Mortars and Pestles</h4>
<p>There were five sandstone mortars found on this site, two of which were
surface finds and which measured respectively (1) 15 cm. in diameter, 6.5 thick
with a central depression of 1.5 cm. and (2) 7.5 cm. &times; 13 cm. &times; 6 cm. thick.
The latter was utilized on both surfaces. The first of these two specimens, made
of red sandstone, was the best of the mortars from this site (<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>;2).</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Associated with house 1 and located near the fire-basin were two mortars.
One of these was 20 &times; 15 &times; 8 cm. and had a central depression of 2 cm. The reverse
side was used as a whetstone. The other mortar was much smaller, measuring
9 &times; 13 &times; 4.5 cm., basin shaped on one side and bearing use marks of a
crude pestle on the other. Associated with these two mortars were six stones
showing wear as crude unmodified stone pestles (<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>;1). Feature 12, a fire
basin, also had a mortar and pestle association. A small mortar 8 &times; 10 &times; 5 cm.
had five stone pestles with it. Four of these stones showed considerable wear
while the fifth was not used.</p>
<p>All of these mortars and pestles were basically unmodified field stones or
river pebbles which gradually received some alteration of shape through use.</p>
<h4 id="c35">Stone Abraders and Whetstones</h4>
<p>There were nine abraders, two of which are of particular interest. One showed
heavy use as an abrader on one side and three edges. Much of this use was as
a sharpener for small pointed objects. The other side, while showing use as an
abrader, was also cupped for grinding purposes. Over much of the surface,
powdered yellow ochre had become impregnated into the porous sandstone. Another
specimen showed long wide grooves on two surfaces while another had
been ground flat. This portion of the stone was heavily impregnated with red
ochre. The other abrading stones were unmodified pieces except for the miscellaneous
grooves resulting from use (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>;1, top).</p>
<p>Four asymmetrical whetstones were found in the general midden. These
were about 5 &times; 8 cm. by 1.5 cm. One of these was bitted at one end much like
a celt. Their use as whetstones was rather obvious (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>;1, bottom).</p>
<h4 id="c36">Pottery and Clay Abraders</h4>
<p>The use of potsherds for abrading is reported from the Mississippi alluvial
valley area as far south as Memphis. It is a very minor trait. The occasional finds
point up this usage as a stop-gap measure when a good stone abrader was not
immediately available. This is a thing to be expected in the relatively stoneless
alluvial valley. At the Lawhorn site 16 sherd abraders have been found. These
show the same haphazard use over their surfaces as do the stone abraders. Ten
of them were from Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry shell tempered sherds and six were made from
the sand tempered sherds. Two of the Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry abraders show only the
narrow pointed type of abrading groove while the other eight show the full
length and width abrading slots such as might have been used for arrow shaft
straightening and smoothing (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>;2, left). All of the sand tempered sherd
abraders show the pointed narrow type of groove none of which are large enough
to be used as shaft grinders (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>;2, right). In spite of the fact that it appears
that sand tempered and shell tempered sherds represent two components with
perhaps a considerable time span between them, it seems most probable that
this use of sherd abraders is to be linked with the Mississippian component and
that the use of the earlier sand tempered sherds by the later people was simply a
convenience procedure. Two burned clay masses, of very sandy clay, were also
used as abraders. These were the pointed narrow type.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h4 id="c37">Anvilstones</h4>
<p>Two anvilstones were found on the surface, one made from limestone and
the other from sandstone. Their opposing surfaces seemed to have been used as
grinders or pestles. Here again, there is multiple usage of rough unmodified
stones. They were seldom pecked or ground to a shape, rather they were modified
through use.</p>
<h4 id="c38">Hammerstones</h4>
<p>Seven pebble hammerstones were found in the general excavations. Most of
them were either sandstone or chert and of nondescript shape ranging in size
from 4 to 8 cm. in diameter. Many of the sandstone specimens showed use as
grinding Stones as well as hammerstones, again pointing up the multiple tool
use of pebbles. The chert pieces were not shaped, showing only the natural
weathered surfaces except where they had been used.</p>
<h4 id="c39">Groundstone Celts</h4>
<p>Six fragments of celts were found, five of which were granite and one hematite.
The five granite specimens consisted of three bit ends and two poll ends
and the hematite specimen was only the central shaft section. These celts were
all small, probably not over 10 to 18 cm. long. The bits were about 4.8 cm. wide
with thickness averaging 2.5 cm. The poll ends were somewhat narrower than
the bits but not pronouncedly so.</p>
<h4 id="c40">Pipes</h4>
<p>Only one pipe was found but it may be of considerable value for interpretation
of the relationship of the site to other areas. It was picked up by Mr. Lawhorn
when his plow turned over a burial. The pipe is made of stone and has a
non-functional stem projection commonly seen on pipes from Spiro (Baerreis,
1957 p. 25). The bowl is quite large and at right angles to the stem (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>;3).
The bowl is slightly elliptical in outline with both sides flattened on their lower
portions. The bottom of the bowl and the stem projection have also been flattened
while the functional portion of the stem is round in cross section. This is
about &#8531; longer than the depth of the bowl. The projection is quite small. There
is a crudely incised groove around the stem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h4 id="c41">Bone and Antler Artifacts</h4>
<p>Bone tools were of common occurrence in the general midden of the site
and were also associated with house patterns 1 and 3. Six deer ulna awls and three
ulna awls from small animals (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>;1); ten splinter awls (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>;4) and a
single fish fin awl; a deer cannon bone beamer (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>;2) and a deer scapula
hoe (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>;3) make up most of the inventory of bone tools. One deer mandible
appeared to have been utilized since a dull work polish is noticeable on it.
The teeth are fractured on one side as if broken off in the course of use.</p>
<p>Bone beads were found associated with house patterns and were made from
bird bones (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>;1 bottom). One measured 1.5 cm. and another 1.3 &times; 1.5 cm.
and a third .8 &times; 2.6 cm. A large bird bone had been in the process of bead manufacture
(<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>;1, top). The bone had been cut at each end then circled in two
places with cuts that hadn&rsquo;t been completed.</p>
<p>Antler tips were utilized for various purposes. Specimens included two barbed
projectile points and one unfinished tip with a drilled base. Twelve other tips
were probably flaking tools.</p>
<h4 id="c42">Brickette and Daub</h4>
<p>Brickette and daub were so scarce that many pieces were catalogued as
specimens. These present an interesting class of materials and give aid far beyond
their intrinsic worth in telling the Lawhorn story. Once again this points
up the value of saving everything found during the course of field work.</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing how much of this material has been lost as a
result of erosion and the almost melting away of softer pieces in the heavy rains
of the passing centuries. Slightly over 100 pieces which were eroded beyond
identification were picked up during the course of excavation. They represent
either daub or broken clay objects of unknown use. There were 103 pieces of
daub, broken into various sizes, which had been heavily impregnated with grass.
Six of these specimens show impressions of small poles which would have been
from 2 to 5 cm. in diameter (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>;2). The composition of the fired material
ranges from a sandy clay to a white ball clay with a heavy sand admixture. It
should be noted that the natural soils of the Lawhorn site do not contain enough
clay to fire into a brickette form. Consequently such brickette as was found
must be the result of clays brought in from a distance.</p>
<p>Most specimens were rather soft and it is doubtful if they had ever been
used as heating stones. Many samples show some surface smoothing as if they
were portions of floors, firebasins or perhaps house walls. It is presumed that if
the daub was used on house walls, the firing was accidental as the result of
house burnings, that only a minor portion of such daub would survive. However,
judging from the burned clay floors and fire basins found, it is evident that
burned clay, as such, fired well enough to withstand the erosion of time. A
higher percentage of wall daub should have been found if it had been extensively
used.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>There were twenty pieces of brickette flattened and smoothed in such a way
as to indicate that they were probably part of house floors. They were smoothed
on one side and grass impregnated on the underside and throughout the body of
the specimen as the result of puddling the clay. They were made of a sandy clay
and ranged in size from 2 to 4 cm. in thickness. The undersurface was irregular
and showed no contact with a prepared surface such as the cane mats of wall
daub specimens would leave.</p>
<p>There were 163 pieces of fired clay objects showing considerable use which
were made of a poorly fired sandy clay. Four specimens were tempered with
crushed shell while one was clay tempered. Most of the others contain some
grass although many are without any apparent tempering material. Use of these
specimens is undetermined. One specimen (FS 425) was a rectanguloid brickette
10 &times; 12.5 cm. and 2 cm. thick with a slightly rounded base (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>;3). This
was found in a form fitting depression on the fired clay floor of house 3. It
shows considerable wear from use, especially on the bottom. It, perhaps, was
used for grinding seeds or rubbing skins. The other clay objects are of different
shapes, seemingly of round cylindrical devices with flat bottoms and rounded
edges. From some of the better samples they appear to be about five inches in
diameter but the length or height could not be determined. They do not show
any appreciable wear. There was no evidence of excessive firing and most of the
specimens crumble easily. The latter may be due to the sandy clay from which
they were formed. It is suggested that these were anvils or stretchers for use in
skin work or other soft materials such as textiles. They certainly were an important
domestic item.</p>
<p>There was one specimen with a central hole, apparently lengthwise, which
suggests that it was suspended, perhaps as a loom weight (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>;1).</p>
<p>The clay objects occur in considerable numbers in all parts of the site and
throughout the deposit and constitute the biggest percentage of all the brickette
material from the site. In point of fact these items are not broken bits of daub,
such as are so common on Mississippian sites, but are items of domestic importance
in the material culture assemblage, and must be so treated in the final
analysis. They are not accidental formations, such as building daub, but have
been precisely formed to a pattern. While many seemed to conform to a cylindrical
shape others did not. One specimen has a groove around it but its position
with reference to the complete object was not apparent. One piece shows a
coarse textile impression on one side and a surface well smoothed on the other.
It is not a potsherd. Another piece shows the imprint of a finger apparently
curled around the clay&mdash;a very small finger&mdash;probably that of a child at play.
One piece looks as if it could have been a pottery trowel, but is a questionable
specimen.</p>
<p>Two of the broken clay objects have been secondarily used as abraders for
sharpening bone awls or similar pointed items. One specimen (FS 217) is the
stem of a pottery trowel, a standard item of Mississippian groups. A complete
modified conical object was recovered from a nearby site and is a graphic representation
of another shape of these objects (<a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>;2).</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>It should be obvious from the above that much of the burned clay material
from Lawhorn is not truly daub but rather fragmentary pieces of a multitude of
domestic utility objects which played an important part in the material culture
of the people.</p>
<h4 id="c43">Shell Artifacts</h4>
<p>Six beads were made from marine shell (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>;1). These were small, being
from 7 to 10 mm. in diameter and 10 to 16 mm. long. One drilled mussel
shell hoe or scraper was found in the general digging and this is typical of the
specimens commonly found on Mississippian sites (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>;2).</p>
<h4 id="c44">Vegetal Remains</h4>
<p>Carbonized food occurred in several instances. A few acorn hulls were found
in Feature 18, a nut shell in Feature 5, both fire basin and a small number of
corn cobs in the general midden excavation. The corn cobs according to Nash,
seem typical of the Eastern Complex corn. They are all fragmentary but three
specimens show a tapering cob. The first of these had twelve rows of kernels
spaced as pairs. The cob was probably not over 6 cm. in length and had a diameter
of 2 cm. some distance from the probable butt. Kernels measured about
4 mm. wide and 2 mm. thick. The second specimen had ten paired rows of kernels
and was 1.6 cm. in diameter. The third specimen had been split longitudinally
but indicated twelve paired rows of kernels. The cob was 1.7 cm. in diameter.
The largest kernels were 5 mm. wide and 2.4 mm. thick (See <a href="#c57">Appendix B</a>).</p>
<h2 id="c45"><span class="small">FEATURES</span></h2>
<h4 id="c46">Refuse Pits</h4>
<p>Eight refuse pits were identified during the course of excavation. The shapes
varied from circular to oblong with considerable range in depth. In most instances,
however, the bottoms were flat, or nearly so. The five examples of pits
with a circular outline ranged from 1.2 feet to 3 feet in diameter and from 1 to
1.5 feet in depth. The three oblong pits ranged from 2.5 to 3.8 feet wide, from
4 to 5 feet long, and from 1.8 to 2.7 feet in depth. Two of the refuse pits were
associated with houses&mdash;one with House 1 and the other with House 3. These
will be described as associations with these houses. Feature 13, a refuse pit, was
unusual in that it contained a number of broken vessels, bone awls, a drilled
pottery disk and a considerable amount of animal bone and potsherds. The vessels
were all jars ranging in size from small to large and were wide mouthed
vessels. Most of these jars had strap handles while the two largest were decorated
with crude incising on the shoulders and by a series of nodes punched from the
inside, below that. A large broken vessel in one of the pits is shown in <a href="#fig29">Figure 29</a>.</p>

<br /><i>(1. Marine shell beads. 2. Perforated mussel shell scraper or hoe.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Little more can be said of these pits except that they represent a method of
disposal of refuse but certainly not the standard approach to this problem.</p>
<h4 id="c47">Ash Pits</h4>
<p>There were a number of ash dumps which were always associated with fireplaces.
They were present in all three of the houses excavated. One outstanding
characteristic is the completeness of combustion represented by the ashes. In no
instance were small charred pieces of wood found with the ash, a thing to be
expected unless the fire burned under forced draft or was carefully tended. While
the ash in the dumps could have been selectively collected so that only the completely
burned ash was thrown out, the same would not be true of the ash found
in every fireplace excavated. It is suggested that this result would be normal
only if low flame charcoal fires were used and these nursed to produce the desired
heat, with red hot coals being buried in the ash to slow down their combustion
until such time as it was desired to rekindle a hotter fire. A further consideration
would be that only this type of fire would be relatively safe inside a
grass thatched house.</p>
<p>House 1 had three ash dumps, two of which were inside the house and in
close contact with the firebasin, and one outside the house. These dumps tended
to be rounded and about two feet in diameter. In depth they ranged from .6 foot
in the center but tapered away to nothing at the outer edges. The single ash
dump associated with house 3 was similar in all respects.</p>
<h4 id="c48">Firebasins</h4>
<p>The firebasins at Lawhorn are quite definite and well formed of puddled
clay and are good examples of those so common to Mississippian sites of the
area. Rebuilding was common, with new construction leaving the remains of
some portion of the old basin to one side. Often this was a half-moon shaped affair
that may have continued in use. In all instances these basins were filled with
a white wood ash which showed complete combustion so that there were no bits
of unburned charcoal left in the ash. It may be that this bed of ash was maintained
in basins at all times and was used to bury hot coals to hold the fire during
periods of non-use. There were numerous specimens found near the fire basins
which added to the impression of domestic hearth sites associated with whatever
house forms these people had. The most notable trait was the presence of stone
mortars and pestles near many of the basins. Drilled pottery disks were also
commonly found nearby. Bone awls were found on one occasion.</p>
<p>House 1 had a fire basin two feet in diameter and without a raised rim section.
It was half filled with white to reddish wood ash without any partially
burned charred material left in it. The fire area in House 3 was not a puddled
basin but rather a flat area on the floor where continued fire building had hardened
the ground underneath. The House 2 basin was puddled but poorly made.
In two of these fireplaces small broken bowls were found half buried in the ash.
Another burned area was found in square 17R13 which also showed use as a
hearth site. Nearby was a circular refuse pit almost flat on the bottom. Here,
carbonized nut hulls were found.</p>

<p>In no instance were postmold patterns found in association with the firebasins
at this site nor, for that matter, were any found in the entire excavation
that could be thought of as forming a pattern.</p>
<p>Feature 12 was a puddled clay fire basin with a rim section .1 foot above the
surrounding floor. The basin was circular in shape with a diameter of 1.3 feet
and a depth of .3 foot. It had been dug into subsoil and so was associated with
the early levels of the site. To one side were two possible postmolds while
nearby was a mortar and several crude pestles. Two bone awls and a drilled pottery
disk were found close to the basin. Feature 14 was a similar fire basin but
it was in poor condition. It was found just above the subsoil in the square just
west of feature 12 and became the center point of an extended trench excavation
in an unsuccessful search for a postmold wall pattern. The basin was filled
with a white wood ash. Two shell tempered sherds were found in this ash.</p>
<p>Feature 18, a firebasin, (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>) also built on subsoil, was of puddled clay
filled completely with wood ash. This ash did not contain any specimen. There
was a burned clay floor .1 foot below the rim of the firebasin but this was not
very extensive and in all probability only surrounded the firebasin area. Once
again, an extended trench excavation was undertaken in a search for postmolds.
The subsoil was a light colored sand and such disturbances as tree roots and pits
were very clear. Indeed many of these tree roots were cross sectioned in an attempt
to locate postmolds. No postmolds of any description were found.</p>
<p>Feature 5 was a large fired area with a heap of ashes extending beyond the
burned clay. The area was circular with a diameter of 1.6 feet and burned to a
depth of .3 foot. Associated with this area was a charred nut, either hickory or
walnut, and a thin flat stone which had been subjected to intense heat.</p>
<p>Feature 24 was very similar to feature 18 in that it, too, had been rebuilt
and enlarged. The rebuilt basin was oval in shape being two feet long by 1.7 feet
wide with an interior depth of .5 foot and a thickness of burned clay wall of .1
foot. The combined length of the basin was 3 feet with a half moon section of
the original basin being all that remained of it. The original basin was about 1.6
feet in diameter. Both sections were filled with wood ash and apparently continued
in use.</p>
<p>Feature 25 was the remaining half of a puddled clay fire basin under house
1. Whether the basin was circular or oval could not be determined due to an
ash pit that had been cut through it. The basin was 1.6 feet in diameter with an
interior depth of .6 foot and a clay wall thickness of .1 foot. The pit was filled
with white wood ash and a few shell tempered sherds.</p>

<h2 id="c49"><span class="small">HOUSES</span></h2>
<p>The evidence for dwellings at Lawhorn rests on two burned structures,
house 1 and house 3, and a fire basin and associated floor area adjacent to house
3. In the main, the evidence is as conclusive as to shape, ground plan and superstructure
as is most such archaeological evidence from Mississippian sites. That
no postmold patterns were discernable during the entire four years of work at
Lawhorn must be taken at face value, especially when the cross sectional data
from house 3 is considered.</p>
<h4 id="c50">House 1</h4>
<p>This house was built on top of subsoil and was rectangular in shape (<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>).
The area of charred remains was ten feet by fifteen feet so that the house
itself must have been at least that large and probably somewhat larger. Final
excavation showed that no posts had been placed in the ground to support the
superstructure. The charred material found on the floor indicated a house built
of light poles, cane and thatch.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of the use of daub on either walls or roof of the
building. The main support poles were about .2 foot in diameter and poles half
this size were interwoven to form a widely spread lattice work. Cane was fastened
on this, apparently in layers, but there was no evidence as to whether this was
woven or bound into mat form. There was no split cane in evidence, only whole
cane poles (<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>). Apparently the entire house was covered with thatch since
evidence of it was found over the whole charred area and overlying the rest of
the charred material. The house did not have a fired clay floor. The floor was
highly compacted, however. There was a central firebasin made of puddled clay
which was two feet in diameter, six inches deep with the lip level with the floor.
It was filled with a white to reddish ash. To one side of the basin was a pile of
ashes in which the skeleton of an infant was found. Outside the house was a refuse
pit and another ash dump. Two mortars and six crude pestles were found
on the floor close to the fire basin. Bone awls, pottery disks and bone beads were
found on the floor. The list of specimens found in association with this house
is as follows: four drilled pottery disks, three undrilled pottery disks, two projectile
points, two bone awls, three bone beads and one pottery vessel.</p>
<h4 id="c51">House 2</h4>
<p>This house had been built on top of subsoil and apparently, it partially underlay
the northern portion of house 3 (Fig. <a href="#fig33">33</a> and <a href="#fig35">35</a>). No new information
came to light here but the size and shape apparently agreed with that of house
1. Here, the central section of the floor was hard burned and had been puddled
with a clay and grass mixture before firing. Central to this floor area was an irregular
and poorly shaped fire basin which was filled with white wood ash. Partially
buried in this ash was a small broken shell tempered pottery bowl (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>).
A few pieces of charred logs were found lying just above the floor of this
house, but, they were too small and too few to be diagnostic of superstructure.
It is even possible that these few pieces were from the house three conflagration.</p>

<h4 id="c52">House 3</h4>
<p>This house was thirteen by fifteen feet as indicated by the charred remains
of the superstructure (<a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a>). Many of the poles appeared to be rafters and
were about .2 foot in diameter. Interwoven between them were small poles forming
a loose lattice work wall or roof (<a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>). Several small sections of cane
matting were found near the basal ends of many poles. Typically these were of
small whole cane laid at right angles to the poles. At one location there was some
split cane matting but it is questionable whether this was part of the wall construction
or was a portion of the house furnishings. Several of the wall poles had
basal ends still in place. These basal ends were apparently resting on the surface
of the ground since they originated at the same level as the house floor. The
group at the southwest corner of the house were .9 foot apart. Cross sectioning
vertical cuts under these posts failed to yield any evidence of postmolds or rotted
out underground portions of the poles (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 37</a>). The evidence would seem to
be quite clear that there were none.</p>
<p>There was considerable evidence of thatch throughout the burned areas although
this was very fragmentary. There were several hard fired floor areas that
seemed to have been made of puddled clay. The fireplace was not dug out but
was simply a central area on the floor identified by the heavy burning, the concentration
of ash, and a small broken bowl buried in this ash (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>). There
was an ash pit to one side of the fireplace which cut down through feature 25,
firebasin. There was no evidence of daub being used in the construction of the
house. One internal feature of extreme interest was a log lying on the floor
which had been hewn to shape (<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>). This was not apparent in the field
but was discovered when the specimen was brought into the lab. Careful study
revealed that the top section of the log had been cut down leaving a ledge at
right angles to it. The split cane matting already mentioned was found in association
with this log and may well have been part of some house furnishings.
Quite a number of specimens were found lying on the floor of this house including
the strap handled water bottle (<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>;5). Another broken vessel was
beneath charred roof or wall timbers (<a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>). Outside the house there was a
refuse pit and an infant burial. Specimens found on the floor are as follows: one
whetstone, four pottery vessels, two broken celts, one projectile point, three
drilled pottery disks, two bone awls, one chipped hoe, one hammerstone, one
rectanguloid clay pad, one bottom of a wooden container and one antler tip.</p>
<p>Much of the interpretation of the house superstructure seems to be based on
good solid evidence, but, even so, much is still conjectural and will remain so
until more evidence is forthcoming. The absence of postmolds and the positive
evidence of wall poles originating on the ground level led to the judgement that
in some way the structure leaned upon itself in self support (<a href="#table5">Table 5</a>).</p>

<p>A hypothetical reconstruction (<a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>) is an &lsquo;A&rsquo; frame building that makes
use of all the archaeological data found here. Other forms might as easily
be conceived including prefabrication of wall sections which could then be bound
at the corners and braced outside against any roof thrust. There is no doubt that
these dwellings were made of poles, cane and thatch and that these materials
were assembled in such a way as to give strength and some degree of permanency
to the house.</p>

<h2 id="c54"><span class="small">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
<p>The location of the Lawhorn site is in the St. Francis River valley in an
area that has had little archaeological investigation. Using the subdivision of the
Alluvial Valley (Phillips, et. al., 1951, Fig. 1) the Lawhorn site comes within
the Malden Plain, and lies between Crowley&rsquo;s Ridge and the Little River Lowland.
The Cairo Lowland lies to the north and east and is separated from the
Malden Plain by the Morehouse Lowland. All except the Morehouse Lowland
were described, at least in part, by Williams (1956). The Malden Plain area is
less well known than the other areas described by Williams. To the south of the
Malden Plain is the Lower St. Francis Basis which was discussed by Griffin in
Archaeology of Eastern United States (1952).</p>
<p>The site is relatively small and seemed to have no more than two components
represented. The materials that were obtained from the site in the preliminary
testing did appear to be somewhat unusual yet not intrusive in the St.
Francis valley area. One reason that the site was picked for excavation is that it
is relatively small in size making it possible for more aspects of the site to be
investigated within a relatively short time. The excavation of the site was, in
part, an experiment to determine whether or not a group of serious amateur
archaeologists could produce information that would be of value to the field of
archaeology and professional and amateur archaeologists alike on the necessary
basis of working on weekends and during vacation time. There were no funds
for the excavation other than those provided by the group of men interested in
carrying out this experiment, and, as is usual in such endeavors, though many
worked on the project, a small nucleus of four did most of the work. There
were 8 to 10 persons who worked as much as a year on the project. In spite of
the changing crews and the difficulties under which the different groups worked,
a rather full sample of the entire site was obtained. The total time spent covered
a period of four years in the field and two years of laboratory work. The work
from start to finish was under the direction of one individual, the writer, and
thus there was always an organization and a continuity to it.</p>
<p>The methodology followed in the excavation is that of accepted hand methods
of archaeology (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>) controlled by making a map of the site and excavating
within a grid system and with depths provided by a farmer&rsquo;s level transit.
All notes and excavation procedures were checked with professional archaeologists
and when some new problem arose a professional archaeologist was contacted
for advise or consultation before the excavations progressed further. Since
time was always at a premium this consultation was many times by telephone
and quite often several long distance phone calls were necessary before some
phase of the work could be carried to a conclusion. Furthermore, the site was
ninety miles from the base station of those working on the project which meant
a round tip of 180 miles on each weekend or other excursion to the site.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The analysis and interpretation of the materials excavated pointed up the
necessity of obtaining many notes and saving all material from the site. Part of
the analysis was done prior to the finish of the excavation and this was helpful
in gaining fuller information from some of the later parts of the excavation.
Most of the analysis was done at the Chucalissa State Park Museum, Memphis,
Tennessee, through the courtesy of the museum director, Charles Nash.</p>
<p>The site covered approximately four acres and the portions excavated included
the village living area with house sites, a plaza area, and cemetery area.
What was considered to be a fair sample was obtained from all of these areas.
Incidental to this sample was the sampling of the earlier component since all
excavations were carried to sterile subsoil.</p>
<p>In the analysis most of the time was spent on the pottery since it seemed
probable that the pottery was the most diagnostic in determining the cultural
position and the time of the site. It was broadly apparent from the beginning of
analysis that the pottery represented two distinct traditions. The greatest part
of it was the standard shell tempered pottery of the area, Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain
with a small percentage of decorated types on the Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain base. The
secondary type was a sand tempered ware that was plain, cord marked and textile
marked. The sand tempered ware was representative of the early component
on the site and was of a type that has not been named for this particular part of
the lower Mississippi valley.</p>
<p>The sand tempered pottery had some variety and was divided upon the basis
of the size of the cord markings as well as the textile markings. Only a small
percentage was plain. Seemingly associated with the sand tempered pottery was
a lithic complex that has not been described elsewhere. The prominent projectile
point or dart point type that appeared to be associated was less than 2&frac12;
inches in length and was relatively thick. It had little or no shoulders and was
approximately twice as long as wide. There were no diagnostic points that were
associated definitely with this component but it is possible that the one Motley
point found on the site gives an indication of the time period of the component.
The Motley points supposedly date between 1300 and 200 B.C. A Uvalde point
was also found on the site but there is no assurance that this was not an accidental
inclusion in the site. Four Gary points were also found but it is just as
possible that these may have been associated with the later component on the
site.</p>
<p>There were no features that could be definitely related to the early component
and it was necessary to separate the early component primarily upon
typology and secondarily upon superposition. One reason for this was the fact
that the site itself is on a very sandy bench of land and it seems probable that the
evidence of the early occupation was shifted and many were exposed at the time
the later occupation took place causing a certain amount of mixing in the deposits.
Furthermore, earthquake activity had disturbed the deposits (<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>).
The old surface that the site lies on is the A1 surface of the Ohio according to
Fisk (1944 Plate 15 sheet 1).</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The sand tempered pottery is very similar to the Barnes series that has been
named in the Cairo Lowland area (Williams 1956). The ware also fits the description
of the Thomas Plain, Blue Lakes cord marked and Twin Lakes fabric
impressed (Phillips, et. al., 1951). It was decided not to utilize the names of the
types from either area since the descriptions were not sufficient for it to be certain
that the cord marked series here could be equated with either the lower alluvial
valley types or the Cairo Lowland area. It does seem relatively certain,
however, that the early component on the site is representative of a period that
may have preceded the Baytown or Middle Woodland period or which may
have been contemporaneous with it. It is of interest that no Baytown Pottery
occurred on the site. The fact that Baytown pottery occurs in some profusion
on sites in the surrounding area might indicate that the early component on the
Lawhorn site is earlier than Baytown and that the site was never utilized during
the Baytown or Middle Woodland period.</p>
<p>It is possible that the sand tempered wares represented in the early component
on the site are a middle Woodland type and the evidence for this is the
fact that the Cairo Lowland area to the north, Williams (1956, in his table 2,
page 32) places Barnes Ridge where the Barnes Series of Sand tempered types
occur after Burkett and Hoecake and prior to Black Bayou. This places it in a
Middle Woodland position. Furthermore on page 29 in Williams Table I he
places the Barnes Ridge component at LaPlant after the Hoecake. The Hoecake
equates with Woodland. Barnes Ridge, in his Table 3 page 38, is noted as Middle
Baytown. This would equate with Middle Woodland in the central Mississippi
valley.</p>
<p>If the situation here in the Malden Plain area is similar to that in the Cairo
Lowland and the sequence that Williams has suggested is correct, this would
explain why no clay tempered Baytown material occurred on the site for this
would be a component of the Middle Baytown period and would be preceded
and perhaps followed by the clay tempered Baytown series.</p>
<p>The late component on the site, or the Mississippian component, is not
easily placed in either its cultural position or the time period in which it existed.
The pottery is rather distinctive and is wholly a Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain and a few
associated decorated types. The Neeley&rsquo;s Ferry Plain vessel shapes consist of
water bottles of two types, the long necked and the short necked and an unusual
amphora water bottle; plates with undifferentiated rims and undecorated with
the exception of red filming; shallow bowls; moderately deep, straight sided
bowls; and deep bowls both straight sided and those with an incurvate side
similar to some of the Caddo wares; and a usual jar form with strap handles and
relatively low rim. A few of the jars are decorated and the most prominent
decorated type is Wallace Incised or something very similar. Another minor
decorated type is Matthews Incised and there are sherds of incised decoration
which were not classified. These may possibly be Barton or Kent Incised but
the number of sherds having the decoration on them and their small size was
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
such that it was not considered desirable to try to classify them. Painted wares
were all under the general term Avenue Painted and consisted of Old Town
Red, Carson Red on Buff and at least one sherd of Nodena Red and White.</p>
<p>The water bottles had a sub-globular shape in most instances and had a fillet
around the base of the neck. They either had a flat base or an annular ring
base that was perforated. The shape in general compared favorably with other
vessels from the general St. Francis River area and to some extent with water
bottles from the Caddoan area to the southwest. The steep sided bowls and the
one incurvate sided bowl are similar to some of the Caddo shapes but these
shapes in the Caddo area are associated with engraved wares and are upon much
different paste.</p>
<p>The appendages on the vessels, both effigies and lugs and handles are of
aid in determining the relationship of the site to other areas. The handles were
perhaps the best guide since they seem to be copies of the typical handles
at Crosno, at Kinkaid and in the general lower Ohio River valley. The
handles have nodes at the top and in some instances have a groove down the
center or have two raised ridges on either side of the strap handle. The strap
handle is the most prominent on the site although a very few loop handles do
occur.</p>
<p>Judging from the pottery, the site is typically St. Francis River Mississippian
of the late B period (Phillips, et. al., 1951), and it has some slight relationship
to the Cairo Lowland area to the north and to the Lower White River
Basin to the south. Both of these relationships might be expected due to the
physical or geographical location of the site between the two areas.</p>
<p>The other more diagnostic artifacts that were used in determining the relationship
of the Lawhorn site to surrounding areas were the projectile points.
The typical projectile point type is a small corner notched arrowhead which has
been named the Scallorn point in Oklahoma and Texas and is supposed to date
between 700 and 1500 A.D. It is also very similar to the Table Rock Corner
Notched arrowhead in southwestern Missouri on the White River which is associated
with a Shell tempered pottery complex&mdash;the latest occupation in the
area. Furthermore, the arrowhead appears to be rather similar to the corner
notched arrowheads associated with the Matthews site and with the Mississippi
cultures in the Cairo Lowland area. Other important arrowhead types that
might aid in the association of the site elsewhere is the Bonham point which
supposedly dates between 800 and 1200 A.D. and which is found in the Caddo
area to the southwest. This point occurs only about a third as frequently as the
Scallorn point which seems to be similar to the relationship expressed by the
pottery from the site. Also occurring are triangular points that are similar to the
rough, ovoid triangular points found at the Campbell site in the Little River
Lowland of the Memphis cultural sub-area, and to the triangular points that are
common on Mississippi sites throughout the central Mississippi Valley. One of
these triangular points, the Fresno, is supposed to date from 800 or 900 to 1600
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
A.D. Another, the Maude point, is noted to date from 1200 to 1500 A.D. These
dates compare favorably with those for the ovoid points, the Young, which date
from 1200 to 1500 A.D. and the Catan, which dates from 500 to 1800 A.D. Another
triangular point that may be important is one that can be classified readily
as a Fort Ancient point and dates from 1200 to 1600 A.D. All of these points
tend to run through the period 1200 to 1500 A.D., which is the general period
that was considered probable as the date of the site by analysis and interpretation
of the pottery. Therefore, the projectile point types from the Late component
appeared to verify the dating of the site in the latter part of the B period
as it has been established in the lower alluvial valley by Phillips, Ford and Griffin
(1951).</p>
<p>There are other items that are associated with the complex that might aid
in establishing its position and its relationship elsewhere. The one pipe hints at
relationships toward the Caddo area for it is similar to those found at Spiro. The
thumbnail scraper is similar to the ones found on the Campbell site and other
late sites in the Mississippi Valley, but the small number of these suggest an
earlier time period. These miscellaneous items strengthen, rather than weaken
the conclusions drawn from the pottery and projectile points.</p>
<p>It is premature to suggest the sequence in this Malden Plain area of the St.
Francis River basin, but it might be helpful to present the sequence here that
will show the position of the Lawhorn components to the probable sequence of
the general area. The Southeast Missouri Area Chronology Chart of Williams
(1956, p. 38, Table 3) has been used, and the probable position of the Lawhorn
components are indicated and underlined. The sequence is Williams (1956, Table 3)
with the addition of the underlined items.</p>

<p>It was not expected that the information contained here is the final answer
to the story of the Lawhorn site or more than a start to finding out about the
people who lived in the Malden Plain area of the St. Francis valley. It is hoped
that this information will be at least a base from which others can work and that
it adds enough new information that it will stimulate more people to do similar
jobs within this area and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>During the final stages of editing, three radio-carbon dates were received
from the University of Michigan Memorial&mdash;Phoenix Project Radio Carbon Laboratory,

<br />ANALYSIS OF VEGETAL REMAINS FROM LAWHORN SITE</h2>
<p class="center"><span class="ss">by
<br />Leonard W. Blake
<br />St. Louis, Missouri</span></p>
<p>There is always a possibility that any sample, particularly a small one, may
not be fully representative. The collection from the Lawhorn site consists of
fragments of seven cobs, all either 10 or 12 rowed. Three of the cobs have
cupule widths ranging from 7.7 to 8.6 mm. It differs from a larger sample from
the Banks site, which is in nearby Crittenden County and which may have been
occupied at about the same time (<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>), in having a higher mean row number
and greater median cupule width. Corn from both these sites shows evidence
of a mixture with low rowed varieties to a lesser extent than that from
the other sites shown in <a href="#table6">Table 6</a>, except that from Mound 34 at Cahokia, which
is presumably earlier (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>).</p>
<p>Previous work on corn from the Northern Mississippi Valley indicates that
row number tended to decrease and cupule width to increase in that area in
time in the protohistoric and historic periods. This has been interpreted as being
the result of an increasing mixture of predominantly 8 rowed Northern Flint
with wide cupules with earlier 14 rowed Tropical Flints slightly modified by possible
traces of Mexican Pyramidal Dent. It is reasonable to expect that the proportion
of the hardier Northern Flints would increase more rapidly in the Northern
part of the valley than in the Southern, particularly, if there was a minor
climatic cooling trend in the period of about 1200-1700 A.D., as Griffin (1960,
p. 27) has suggested.</p>
<p>Northern Flint was present in the Southeast as well as in the North before
European settlement. Brown and Anderson (1947, pp. 8-13) found Northern
Flint in collections of corn from archaeological sites in Northeastern Alabama,
Eastern Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia as well as in greater concentrations
in Western New York and the Upper Ohio Valley. Actually, a lot of corn
at the Missouri Botanical Garden from a Georgia site poses some of the same
problems as that from Lawhorn. Mean row number is just under 11 and there
are no 14 rowed ears. Cupule width of all but a few of the cobs ranges from 7
to 11 mm. with a median of 9 mm. It is suspected that the wide cupules on the
three Lawhorn cobs might be attributed to diffusion of Northern Flint from the
Southeast as readily as from the North, possibly in diluted form. In the case of
the Banks site, Cutler and Blake (1961) suggested that the influence of Northern
Flint may have reached there in the form of a mixture rather than directly or,
alternatively, that low row numbered corn may have entered from the Southwest
where 8 and 10 rowed corn was dominant after 700 A.D.</p>

<br />BURIALS AT THE LAWHORN SITE</h2>
<p class="center"><span class="ss">by
<br />Charles H. Nash
<br />Memphis, Tennessee</span></p>
<p>The 35 burials from which we can get some data concerning sex and age
groups seem to represent a relatively homogeneous group. Over half of the 26
adult burials were either too fragmentary for any further determination or the
bone was not recovered during the course of excavation. In such instances, age
group associations were made in the field. Burial determinations in Tables <a href="#table8">8-11</a>
were made in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Of the 35 burials, twelve, or 34% had grave goods which included, in all
cases, pottery vessels. Two burials had single beads with them but these were
probably items of dress and not mortuary offerings. The only other object found
was a questionable association of a flint drill. There were only three burials,
9%, which had more than one vessel in association and, of these, one had two
bowls, another had a bottle and a bowl and the third had a bottle, a bowl and
a small jar. Twenty three, or 66%, of the burials had no grave goods with them.
The pottery vessels were divided about evenly between bottles and bowls.</p>
<p>There were fourteen adult burials from which closer age criteria were available.</p>
<p>The two females in their early twenties were not representative of the burial
customs of these people, being in fact depositions of scattered bone showing
little or no orientation and obviously not articulated. The crushing of the bone
was probably due to earth moving machinery of recent years, but the general
broken nature of the bones may more likely be the work of the Indians themselves.
These bones appeared to have been laid on the ground and then covered
over and it would seem that both had been interred at the same time. Both individuals
show heavy charring of the bone; in one instance the feet were intensely
charred with the rest of the bone showing progressively less toward the
skull and the skull showing none. The most intense heat was obviously at the
feet. The hands and lower arms also show heavy charring. The other individual
was more generally charred but once again little or no burning appeared around
the skull. These burials were not cremated at the spot at which they were found
since there was no evidence of a heavy fire there. It must be assumed that the
burning occurred elsewhere and that after further mutilation the bones were
finally interred at this place. It is difficult not to conclude that these young
ladies were victims of tribal displeasure.</p>
<p>Insufficient skeletal material has been recovered and is in too fragmentary
condition to yield a great deal of information. It might be well to mention at
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
this point that &lsquo;week end&rsquo; archaeology is hard put to produce a satisfactory record
of this type of material. The days&rsquo; activities of locating and staking a square,
preliminary excavation and organization take up so much time that once a skeleton
is located there is insufficient time to uncover it properly, record it and remove
the bones with minimum damage. Even if the material is in good condition
it is hard to do an adequate job in one day; if the bone is in a poor state
of preservation the job becomes much more complicated. The specimens come
easy but to clean, photograph, record and remove skeletal material will almost
always require a second day. The thought comes to mind that with proper preparation
much could be removed encased in protective materials for further processing
at home thereby speeding up the process in the field. There are a number
of ways this can be done, from using plaster impregnated burlap over the
entire burial to wrapping bones in crumpled newspaper with much of the surrounding
earth still in place and carefully placing in cartons large enough to
hold them freely. Transportation must be handled with equal care. Much important
information concerning the people themselves, their diet and health can
be learned from skeletal material and no amateur &ldquo;week end&rdquo; archaeologist
should feel free to ignore this class of data or throw it away.</p>
<p>This sampling of skeletons is perhaps ample to give a general picture of the
burial customs of these people. The universal position was supine and apparently
laid out on top of the ground or in a shallow scooped out grave no deeper than
the body itself. This then was presumably covered with a mound of earth and
possibly marked by logs until decay had once again leveled the ground. There
was no evidence of the use of pits. Grave goods, when present, were always pottery
vessels presumably containing food and water for the departed. These
were placed at the head. There was little or no evidence of clothing or decoration
other than the two beads mentioned before.</p>
<p>This burial complex is more like the extended burials of the Walls focus to
the south than other comparable groups. Even the use of bottles and bowls together
is suggestive. The almost total absence of grave goods other than pottery
and the positioning around the head is again a Walls trait, as is the complete
absence of other grave goods with many burials. This is the major evidence
of Walls focus traits among the Lawhorn folk and even here the bottle
form is at quite some variance.</p>
